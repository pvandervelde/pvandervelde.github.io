Software development pipeline - Design flexibilty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="post-meta"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div id="post-content"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="Software-development-pipeline-Design-introduction.html"&gt;fourth property&lt;/a&gt; to consider is
&lt;em&gt;flexibility&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. the ability of the pipeline to be able to be modified or adapted without
requiring large changes to be made to the underlying pipeline code and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pipeline should be flexible because the products being build, tested and deployed with that
pipeline may require different workflows or processes in order for them to complete all the
stages in the pipeline. For example building and packaging a library will require a different
approach then building, testing and deploying a cloud service.
Additionally the different stages in the pipeline will require different approaches, e.g. build steps
will in general be executed by a build system returning the results in a synchronous way, however
test steps might run on a different machine from the process that controls the test steps so those
results might come back via an asynchronous route.
Finally flexibility in the pipeline also improves resilience since in case of a disruption
an adaptable or flexible pipeline will allow restoring services through alternate means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a flexible pipeline is achieved in the same way flexibility is achieved in other software
products, by using modular parts, standard inputs and outputs and carefully considered design. Some
of the appropriate options are for instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Split the pipeline into stages that take standard inputs and deliver standard outputs. There might
be many different types of inputs and outputs but they should be known and easily shared between
processes and applications. There can be one or more stages, e.g. build, test and deploy, which
are dependent on each other only through their inputs and outputs. This allows adding more stages
if required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow steps or stages in the pipeline to be started through a response to a standard notification.
That allows each step to determine what information it needs to start execution. Additional
information can be downloaded from the appropriate sources upon receiving a notification. This
approach allows notifications to be generic while steps can still acquire the information they
need to execute. Additionally having pipeline steps respond to notifications means that it is
very easy to add new steps in the process because a new executor only has to be instantiated
and connected to the message source, e.g. a distributed queue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a stage consists of multiple, dependent steps, then it should be easy to add and remove
steps based on the requirements. In these cases it would generally be preferred that a stage like
this executes one or more scripts as they are easier to extend than services. As with the stages steps
should ideally use well-known inputs and produce well-known outputs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inputs for stages and steps are for instance
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Source information, e.g. a commit ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artefacts, e.g. packages installers, zip files etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meta data, additional information attached to a given output or input, e.g. build or test results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outputs generated by stages and steps are for instance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexibility of the workflow is can further be improved by making sure that the artefacts
generated in the pipeline are not created, tested and deployed in a single monolithic process even
if the end result should be a single artefact. In many cases artefacts can be assembled from smaller
components. Using this approach improves the workflow for the development teams because smaller
components can be created much quicker and in general assembly of a larger piece from components
is quicker and more flexible than regeneration of the entire piece from scratch. In many cases only
a few components will be recreated which both saves time and allows much of the process to be executed
in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact implementation of the pipeline determines how flexible and easy to extend it will be.
Given that the use and implementation of the pipeline vary quite a lot it is hard to provide
detailed implementation details, however some standard suggestions are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep the build part of the pipeline described in the scripts given that scripts are, in general,
easier to adapt. By pulling the scripts from a package, e.g. a NuGet or NPM package, it is
quick and easy to update to a later version of these scripts. An additional benefit of
keeping the process in the scripts is that developers can execute the individual steps of the pipeline
from their local machines. That allows them to ensure builds / tests work before pushing to the
pipeline and provides a means of building things if the pipeline is not available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any part of the process that cannot be done by a script, e.g. test systems, items that need services, e.g.
certificate signing, which require that the certificates are present on the current machine, something
which might not be possible to do on every machine etc., should have a service that is available to both
the pipeline and the developers executing the scripts locally. For any services that should only
be provided to the build server, e.g. signing, the scripts should allow skipping the steps that
need the service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For stages that execute scripts, e.g. the build stage, jobs can be automatically generated
from information stored in source control. This makes it easy to update the actions executed by these
stages without requiring developers to perform the configuration manually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final note one should consider how the pipeline will be described. It is easier to reason about
a pipeline if the entire description of that pipeline is stored in a single file, ideally in source
control. However as the pipeline evolves and more steps and stages are executed in parallel it will
become increasingly difficult to capture the entire pipeline in a single file. While harder to
reason about it is in the end simpler and more flexible to let the pipeline layout, as in the stages,
steps and orders of these items, be determined by the executors that are available and listening for
notifications. That way it's easy to change the layout of the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that we have come to the end of this journey into the guiding principles of designing
a build and release pipeline. There are of course many additions that can be made with regards to
the general design process and even more additions for specific use cases. Those however will have
to wait until another post.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div id="post-content"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="Software-development-pipeline-Design-introduction.html"&gt;third property&lt;/a&gt; to consider is
&lt;em&gt;resilience&lt;/em&gt;, which in this case means that the pipeline should be able to cope with
expected and unexpected changes to the environment it executes in and uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Woods defines &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276139783_Four_concepts_for_resilience_and_the_implications_for_the_future_of_resilience_engineering"&gt;four different types of ‘resilience’&lt;/a&gt; in a paper in the journal of reliability engineering and system safety. One of the different types
is the generally well known form of robustness, i.e. the ability to absorb pertubations or disturbances.
In order to be robust for given disturbances one has to know in advance where the disturbances will
come from, e.g. in the case of a development pipeline it might be expected that pipeline stages will
fail and will polute or damage parts or all of the executor it was running on. Robustness in this
case would be defined as the ability of the pipeline to handle this damage, for instance by repairing
or replacing the executor. The other definitions for resilience are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rebound, the ability to recover from trauma: In order to achieve this capacity ahead of time is
required, i.e. in order to recover from a disturbance one needs to be able to deploy capabilities
and capacity that was available in excess before the issues occurred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graceful extensibility, the ability to extend adaptive capacity in the face of surprise. This is
the ability to stretch resources and capabilities in the face of surprises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sustained adaptibility, which is the ability to adapt and grow new capabilities in the face of
unexpected issues. In general this definition applies more to systems / layered networks where
the loss of sub-systems can be compensated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which ever definition of resilience is used in general the goal is to be able to recover from
unexpected changes and return back to the normal state, ideally with minimal intervention. An interesting
side note is that returning back to normal after major trauma can be deceiving because the ‘normal’ as
experienced before the trauma will be different from the 'normal' experienced after the trauma due
to the lessons learned from the trauma and permanent changed caused by the trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally it is not just the unexpected or traumatic changes that are interesting in the case of a
development pipeline but also the expected ones, e.g. upgrades, maintenance etc., because in general
it is important for the pipeline to continue functioning while those changes are happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a development pipeline resilience can be approached on different levels. For instance the
pipeline should be resilient against:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes in the environment which range from small changes, e.g. additional tools being deployed,
to big changes, e.g. migration of many of the services, and from expected, i.e. maintenance or
planned upgrades, to unexpected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes in the inputs and the results of processing those inputs which may range from build and test
errors to issues with executors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invalid or incorrect configurations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once it is known what resilience actually means and what type of situations the pipeline is expected
to be able to handle the next question is how the pipeline can handle these situations, both in
terms of what the expected responses are and in terms of how the pipeline should be designed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a mirriad of simple steps that can be taken to provide a base level of resilience. None
of these simple steps will guard against major trauma but they will be able to either prevent or
smooth out many of the smaller issues that would otherwise cause the development team to lose faith
in the pipeline outputs. Some examples of simple steps that can be taken to improve resilience in
a development pipeline are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each pipeline step ensure that it is executed in a clean ‘workspace’, i.e. a directory or drive,
that will only ever be used by that specific single step. This workspace should be 'private' to the
specific pipeline step and no other processes should be allowed to execute in this workspace. This
prevents issues with unexpected changes to the file system. There are still cases where ‘unexpected’
changes to the file system can occur, for instance when running parallel executions within the same
pipeline step in the same workspace. This type of behaviour should therefore be avoided as much as
possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not depend on global, i.e. machine, container or network, state. Global state has a tendency
to change in random ways at random times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid using source which are external to the pipeline infrastructure becaues these are prone to
unspected random changes. If a build step requires data from an external source then the external
source should be mirrored and mirrors should be carefully controled for their content. This should
prevent issues with external packages and inputs changing or disappearing, e.g.&lt;a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/"&gt;leftpad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If external sources are suitably mirrored inside the pipeline infrastructure then it is possible
to remove the caches for these external sources on the executors. By pulling data in fresh from the
local data store cache polution issues can be prevented&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that each resource is appropriately secured against undesirable acces. This is especially
true for the executor resources. It is important to note that pipeline steps are essentially random
scripts from an unknown source, even if the scripts are pulled from internal sources, because the
scripts will not be security verified before being used. This means that the pipeline scripts should
not be allowed to to make any changes or to obtain secrets that they shouldn't have access to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned the afforementioned steps form a decent base for improving resilience and they are
fairly easy to implement, hence they make a good first stage in the improvement of the resilience
of the development pipeline. Once these steps have been implemented more complex steps can be taken
to futher improve the state of the development pipeline. These additional steps can be divided into
items that help prevent issues, items that test and verify the current state, items that aid in
recovery and finally items, like logging and metrics, that help during post-mortems of failure cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way prevention of trauma / outages can partially be improved is by ensuring that all parts of the
development pipeline are able to handle different error states which can be achieved by building in
extensive error handling capabilities, both for known cases, e.g. service offline, and general error
handling for unexpected cases. For the tooling / script side of the pipeline this means for instance
adding error handling structures nearly everywhere and providing the ability to retry actions.
For the infrastructure side of the pipeline this could mean providng highly available services and
ensuring that service delivery gracefully degrades if it can no longer be provided at the required
standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if every possible precaution is taken it is not possible to prevent all modes of failure. Unexpected
failures will always occur no matter what the capabilities of the development pipeline are. This means
that some of the way to improve resilience is to provide capabilities to recover from failures and to
recognise that unexpected conditions exist and to notify the users and administrators of this situation.
It should be noted that providing these capabilities may be much harder to implement due to the
flexible nature of the issues that are being solved for these cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By exposing the system continuously to semi-controlled unexpected conditions it is possible to
provide early and controlled feedback to the operators and administrators regarding the resilience
of the development pipeline. One example of this is the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy/wiki/Chaos-Monkey"&gt;chaos monkey approach&lt;/a&gt; which tests the
resilience of a system by randomly taking down parts of the system. In a well designed system this
should result in a response of the system in order to restore the now missing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual handling of unexpected conditions requires that the system has some capability to instigate
recovery which can for instance consist of having fall-back options for the different sub-systems,
providing automatic remediation services which monitor the system state and apply different standard
recovery techniques like restarting failing services or machines or creating new resources to replace
missing ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the high level descriptions given above it is hopefully clear that it will not be easy to create
a resilient development pipeline and depending on the demands placed on the pipeline many hours of
work will be consumed by improving the current state and learning from failures. In order to ensure
that this effort is not a wasted effort it is definitely worth applying iterative improvement approaches
and only continuing the improvement process if there is actual demand for improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

Software development pipeline - Design performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="post-meta"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div id="post-content"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="Software-development-pipeline-Design-introduction.html"&gt;second property&lt;/a&gt; to consider is
&lt;em&gt;performance&lt;/em&gt;, which in this case means that the pipeline should provide feedback on the quality of
the current input set as soon as possible in order to reduce the length of the feedback cycle. As is
&lt;a href="https://www.richard-banks.org/2013/04/why-short-feedback-cycle-is-good-thing.html"&gt;known&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.ambysoft.com/essays/whyAgileWorksFeedback.html"&gt;having&lt;/a&gt; a short
&lt;a href="https://continuousdelivery.com/2012/08/why-software-development-methodologies-suck/"&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt;
cycle makes it easier for the development teams to make improvements and fix issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main components to development pipeline performance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How quickly can one specific input set be processed completely by the pipeline. In other words
how much time does it take to push a single input set through the pipeline from the initial change
to the delivery of the final artefacts. This depends on the number of steps in the development
pipeline and how quickly each step can be executed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How quickly can a large set of input sets be processed. The maximum number of executors will most
likely be limited to some maximum value. The pipeline is limited in the number of simultaneous
input sets it can process by the number of available executors. How quickly the pipeline can
process large number of input sets depends both on the time necessary to process a single input set
and the relation between the total number of input sets and the number of executors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimizing the combination of these two components will lead to a development pipeline which is
designed for maximum throughput for the development team. One important note to make is that a high
performing pipeline will not not necessarily be the most resource efficient pipeline. For instance
the development pipeline may only be fully loaded a few times a week. From a resource perspective
the pipeline components are more than capable of dealing with the load, in fact the components may
even be oversized. However because one of the main goals of the pipeline is to deliver fast feedback
to the development teams the actual sizing of the pipeline and its components depends more on the
way the pipeline will be loaded over time, e.g. will the jobs come as a constant stream or in
blocks, will the jobs be small or large or will it be a mixture of both. In some cases the loading
pattern can be accurately predicted while in other cases it is completely unpredictable.
In general the pattern will depend on the workflow followed by the development team and the geographical
distribution of the team. For instance when the team follows the Scrum methodology it is
likely, though not necessary, that there will be more builds in the middle of the sprint than at the
start or end. On the other hand when using the Kanban methodology the load on the system should be
fairly consistent. Additionally geographical distribution of the development team influences the
times that the pipeline will be loaded. If all of the team is in a single geographical location then
higher loads can be expected during the day while lighter loads are be expected during the evening
and night. However if the team is distributed across the globe it is more likely that the loading will
be more consistent across the day due to the fact that the different locations have ‘office hours’ at
different times in the day, as seen from the perspective of the different servers which are part of
the development pipeline. Taking these issues into account when sizing the capacity of the development
pipeline may lead to increasing the capacity of the pipeline because the the current peak loading
during working hours results in wait times which are too large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this high level information it is possible to start improving the performance of the development
pipeline. This obviously leads to the question: “What practical steps can we take”. As per normal when
dealing with performance improvements it is hard to provide solutions because these depend
on the specific situation. It is however possible to provide some more general advise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very first step to take when dealing with performance is always to measure everything. In the case
of the development pipeline it will be useful to gather metrics constantly and to automatically process
these metrics into several key performance indicators, e.g. the number of input sets per time span, which
describes the loading pattern, the waiting times for each input set before it is processed and the
time taken to process each input set. These key performance indicators can then be used to keep
track of performance improvements as changes are made to the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important issue to keep in mind with regards to performance is that unlike with accuracy performance
may change over time even if there are no &lt;em&gt;changes&lt;/em&gt; to the system because the performance of the
underlying infrastructure might change, for instance when disks fill up, the network load changes or
the hardware ages. This means it will be important to track performance trends over longer periods of
time to average out the influences of temporary infrastructure changes, e.g. network loading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that out of the way some of the standard steps that can be taken are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each pipeline stage should only perform the necessary steps to achieve the desired goal. This for
instance means that partial builds are better than full rebuilds, from a performance perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only gather data that will be used during the current stage. Gathering data that is not required
wastes time, thus smaller input sets are quicker to process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When pulling data locality matters. Pulling data off the local disk is faster than pulling it off
the network, pulling data off the local network is faster than pulling it from the WAN or the internet.
Additionally data that is not local should be cached so that it only needs to be retrieved once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that pipeline stages run on suitable ‘hardware’, either physical or virtual. Ideally the
stage is executed on hardware that is optimized for the performance demands of the step, e.g.
execute I/O bound steps on hardware that has fast I/O etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to these improvements it will be important to review and improve the ability of the
pipeline to execute many input sets in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that the pipeline applications which deal with the distribution of input sets are efficient
at this task. It's not very useful to start processing an input set only to find out that there
are no executors which can process this given input set (I'm looking at you TFS2013).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Splitting a single stage into multiple parallel stages will improve throughput for a single input
set. However it might decrease overall throughput due to the fact that a single input set requires
the use of multiple executors. Note that splitting a single stage into many parallel stages might
lead to reductions in performance due to the overhead of transitioning between stages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mentioned improvements form a start for improving the performance of the pipeline. Depending on
the specific characteristics of a given pipeline other improvements and design choices may be valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally it must be mentioned that some performance improvements will have negative influences on the
other &lt;a href="Software-development-pipeline-Design-introduction.html"&gt;properties&lt;/a&gt;. For instance using partial
builds may influence accuracy. In the end a trade-off will need to be made when it comes to changes
that influence multiple properties.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div id="post-content"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As part of learning more about infrastructure creation, testing and deployment one of the projects
I'm working on is creating a set of virtual machine images for &lt;a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/base.windows"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/base.linux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; which can be used as a base for more complex
virtual machine based resources, e.g. &lt;a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/resource.hashi.server"&gt;a consul host&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/resource.container.host.linux"&gt;a docker host&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main virtualization technology I use is Hyper-V on both Windows 10 and Windows 2016 which allows
creating &lt;a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn282285(v=ws.11).aspx"&gt;Generation 2&lt;/a&gt; virtual machines.
Some of the
&lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/plan/should-i-create-a-generation-1-or-2-virtual-machine-in-hyper-v"&gt;benefits of a generation 2&lt;/a&gt;
virtual machine are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boot volume up to 64 Tb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface"&gt;UEFI&lt;/a&gt; for the boot process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faster boot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial version of the base resources allowed creating a virtual machine with
&lt;a href="https://packer.io"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt; and exporting that virtual machine to be used as a base. However ideally
all one would need is the virtual hard-drive. The virtual machine configuration can easily be
created for each individual resource and the configuration is usually specific to the original
host by virtue of it containing the absolute path of the virtual hard drive, the name of the network
interfaces etc..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When building Ubuntu virtual disk images one of the issues with using a Generation 2 virtual machine is that
it uses UEFI for the boot process. It turns out that the Ubuntu install process stores the UEFI files
in the &lt;a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/virtual_pc_guy/2015/02/11/copying-the-vhd-of-a-generation-2-linux-vmand-not-booting-afterwards/"&gt;virtual machine configuration file&lt;/a&gt;.
This means that when one creates a new virtual machine from the base virtual disk image it runs into
a problem when booting because the boot files are not present in the new machine. The result is this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" alt="Hyper-V error message due to missing UEFI sector" src="/assets/images/infrastructure/hyperv-gen2-ubuntu-missing-uefi-sector-result.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to this issue obviously is to force the Ubuntu installer to write the UEFI files to the
virtual hard disk which can be achieved by adding the correct configuration values to the
&lt;a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/armhf/apb.html"&gt;preseed file&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately the
documentation for the different options in the preseed files is hard to find. In the end a combination
of the &lt;a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/example-preseed.txt"&gt;ubuntu sample preseed&lt;/a&gt; file,
bug reports, old forum messages and a few blog
&lt;a href="https://blog.jhnr.ch/2017/02/23/resolving-no-x64-based-uefi-boot-loader-was-found-when-starting-ubuntu-virtual-machine/"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt;
allowed me to determine that to make the Ubuntu installer place the UEFI files in the correct location
two parts of the preseed file needed to be changed from the default Ubuntu one. The first
part is the partitioning section which requires that at least an &lt;code&gt;EFI&lt;/code&gt; partition and (most likely)
a &lt;code&gt;boot&lt;/code&gt; partition are defined. This almost requires that a custom recipe is defined. The one
I currently use looks as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Or provide a recipe of your own...
# If not, you can put an entire recipe into the preconfiguration file in one
# (logical) line. This example creates a small /boot partition, suitable
# swap, and uses the rest of the space for the root partition:
d-i partman-auto/expert_recipe string       \
    grub-efi-boot-root ::                   \
        1 1 1 free                          \
            $bios_boot{ }                   \
            method{ biosgrub }              \
        .                                   \
        256 256 256 fat32                   \
            $primary{ }                     \
            method{ efi }                   \
            format{ }                       \
        .                                   \
        512 512 512 ext4                    \
            $primary{ }                     \
            $bootable{ }                    \
            method{ format }                \
            format{ }                       \
            use_filesystem{ }               \
            filesystem{ ext4 }              \
            mountpoint{ /boot }             \
        .                                   \
        4096 4096 4096 linux-swap           \
            $lvmok{ }                       \
            method{ swap }                  \
            format{ }                       \
        .                                   \
        10000 20000 -1 ext4                 \
            $lvmok{ }                       \
            method{ format }                \
            format{ }                       \
            use_filesystem{ }               \
            filesystem{ ext4 }              \
            mountpoint{ / }                 \
        .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that syntax for the partioner section is very particular. Note especially the  dots (&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;) at
the end of each section. If the syntax isn't completely correct nothing will work but no sensible
error messages will be provided.
Additionally the Ubuntu install complained when there was no &lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt; section so I added one. This
shouldn't be necessary to get the UEFI files in the correct location but it is apparently necessary
to get Ubuntu to install in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the preseed file that should be changed is the &lt;code&gt;grub-installer&lt;/code&gt; section. There
the following line should be added&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;d-i grub-installer/force-efi-extra-removable boolean true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This line indicates that grub should force install the UEFI files, thus overriding the normal state
of not installing the UEFI boot files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that the complete preseed file looks as follows&lt;/p&gt;

Software development pipeline - Design accuracy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="post-meta"&gt;

Monday, September 4, 2017
 |         Posted in                     &lt;a id="post-category" role="button" href="/tags/delivering-software" class="btn btn-default btn-xs"&gt;Delivering software&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div id="post-content"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#ISO_definition_.28ISO_5725.29"&gt;ISO&lt;/a&gt; defines
accuracy as the combination of &lt;a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/correct?q=correctness"&gt;correctness&lt;/a&gt;,
in agreement with the true facts, and &lt;a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/consistency"&gt;consistency&lt;/a&gt;,
always behaving or performing in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason to value &lt;em&gt;accuracy&lt;/em&gt; as the number one characteristic of the development pipeline is
because it is important for the development teams to be able to rely on the outputs of the
pipeline, whether they are product artefacts, test results or output logs. Without the accuracy
the development teams will eventually lose their trust in the development pipeline, meaning that
they will start ignoring the results because the teams assume that a failure is one of the system
instead of one caused by the input set. Once the development teams lose the trust in the
pipeline it will take a lot of work to regain their trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we know that having a development pipeline which delivers correct results is important the
next step is to determine how accuracy can be built into the development pipeline.
In theory this task is a simple one, all one has to do is to ensure that all the parts that form the
pipeline behave correctly for all input sets. However as indicated by
&lt;a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?DifferenceBetweenTheoryAndPractice"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which means that practically achieving accuracy is a difficult task due to the
many, often complex, interactions between the pipeline components. As a reminder
the &lt;a href="Software-development-pipeline-Design-introduction.html"&gt;components&lt;/a&gt; the
development pipeline consists of are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The scripts that are used during the different parts of the cycle, i.e. the build, test
and release scripts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The continuous integration system which is used to execute the different scripts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tools, like the compiler, test frameworks, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this categorization of the pipeline parts and the previous statement one possible
way of approaching accuracy for a development pipeline is to first ensure that all the parts
are individually accurate. As a second stage the changes in accuracy due to interaction between
the parts can be dealt with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the scripts, tools and continuous integration system this means that each input returns a
correct response and does so consistently for each input set. Fortunately most scripts
and tools do so for the majority of the inputs. In cases where a tool returns an incorrect response
the standard software development process should be followed by recording an issue, scheduling the
issue and implementing, testing and deploying a new version of the tool. In this process
it is important to test thoroughly to ensure that the changes do not negatively impact
tool accuracy. Additionally it is important to execute both (automated) regression testing against known
input sets as well as high level (automated) smoke tests of the entire development pipeline
to validate that the issue has been fixed and no further issues have been introduced.
In order to minimize disruption to the development teams tests should be conducted outside
business hours if no test environment is available, i.e. if the production development
pipeline has to be used for the final tests. It is of course better if a test environment
is available so that testing can take place during business hours without affecting
the development teams. As a side note; having a test environment with a copy of the
development pipeline allows for the development of new features and other changes
while the production pipeline is in use, thus making it easier and quicker to evolve
the pipeline and its capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the approach to development and improvement of the tools taken care of the other area that
needs to be carefully controlled is the infrastructure on top of which the development pipeline
executes. For infrastructure the biggest issues are related to outages of different parts of
the infrastructure, e.g. the network or the different services. In most cases
failures on the infrastructure level do not directly influence the correctness of the development
pipeline. It is obviously possible for a failure in the infrastructure to lead
to an incorrect service being used, e.g. the test package manager instead of the
production one. However unless other issues are present, i.e. the test package manager
has packages of the same version but different content, it is unlikely that
a failure in the infrastructure will allow artefacts to pass the development pipeline
while they should not. A more likely result is that failures in the infrastructure
lead to failures in the development pipeline thus affecting the ability of the
pipeline to deliver the correct results consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The types of issues mentioned can mostly be prevented by using the modern approaches
to IT operations like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_configuration_management"&gt;configuration management&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ImmutableServer.html"&gt;immutable servers&lt;/a&gt; to ensure
that the state of the infrastructure is known, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_monitor"&gt;monitoring&lt;/a&gt;
to ensure that those responsible for operations are notified of issues and
standard operating procedures and potentially auto-remediation scripts to
quickly resolve issues that arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that it is not necessary, though extremely helpful, for the infrastructure
to be robust in order to provide an accurate development pipeline. Tooling can, and
probably should, be adapted to handle and correct for infrastructure failures as
much as possible. However as one expects it is much easier to build a development
pipeline on top of a robust infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final part of the discussion on the accuracy of the development pipeline deals
with the relation between accuracy and the interaction of the tools and infrastructure.
The main issue with interaction issues is that they are often hard to understand
due to the, potentially large, number of components involved. Additionally certain
interaction issues may only occur under specific circumstances like high load or
specific times of the day / month / year, e.g. daylight savings or on leap days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the complexity it is important when building and maintaining a development pipeline
to following the normal development process, i.e. using version control,
(unit) testing, continuous integration, delivery or deployment, work item tracking
and extensive testing etc. for all changes to the pipeline. This applies to the scripts
and tools as well as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_Code"&gt;infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;.
Additionally it is especially important to execute thorough regression testing for any change to the
pipeline to ensure that a change to a single part does not negatively influence the
correctness of the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally in order to ensure that the correctness of the pipeline can be maintained, and improved
if required, it is sensible to provide monitoring of the pipeline and the underlying infrastructure
as well as ensuring that all parts of the pipeline are versioned, tools and infrastructure alike,
and versions of all the parts are tracked for each input set.&lt;/p&gt;

of &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild"&gt;nBuildKit&lt;/a&gt;
has been released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release made the following minor changes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/316"&gt;Removed&lt;/a&gt; the custom tasks assembly
from the &lt;code&gt;nBuildKit.MsBuild.Actions&lt;/code&gt; NuGet package because those were never used from that package
as they are also in the &lt;code&gt;nBuildKit.MsBuild.Tasks&lt;/code&gt; NuGet package&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a deployment step to get &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/318"&gt;VCS information&lt;/a&gt;
during the deploy process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/317"&gt;missing bootstrap steps&lt;/a&gt;
in the test and deploy stages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div id="post-content"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In order to deliver new or improved software applications within the desired
time span while maintaining or improving quality modern development moves towards
&lt;a href="https://techbeacon.com/doing-continuous-delivery-focus-first-reducing-release-cycle-times"&gt;shorter development and delivery&lt;/a&gt;
cycles. This is often achieved through the use of agile processes and a development
workflow including &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration"&gt;Continuous Integration&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery"&gt;Continuous Delivery&lt;/a&gt;
or even &lt;a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/continuous-deployment"&gt;Continuous deployment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the consequences of this desire to reduce the development cycle time on the
development process is that more tasks in the development workflow
have to be automated in order to reduce the time taken for the specific task.
One way this automation can be achieved is by creating a
&lt;a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1621865&amp;amp;seqNum=2"&gt;development pipeline&lt;/a&gt; which
takes the source code and moves it through a set of largely automatic transformations, e.g. compilation,
testing, packaging and potentially deployment, to obtain a validated, and potentially deployed, application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to configure a development pipeline, whether that is on-prem or in the cloud, for
one or more development teams one will have to understand what the requirements are which
are placed on the pipeline, which tooling is available to create the pipeline, whether the
pipeline will be situated on-prem, in the cloud or a combination and
how the pipeline will be assembled and managed. In this post series some of
these issues will be discussed starting with the requirements or considerations that need
to be given to the characteristics or behaviours of the development pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to discussing what the considerations are for selecting tooling and infrastructure
for a development pipeline, it is important to decide what elements are part of the pipeline
and which elements are not. For the remainder of this
post series the development pipeline is considered to consist of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The scripts that are used during the different parts of the cycle, i.e. the build, test
and release scripts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The continuous integration system which is used to execute the different scripts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tools, like the compiler, test frameworks, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Items like version control, package management, issue tracking, system monitoring,
customer support and others are not included in the discussion. While these systems
are essential in application development and deployment each of these systems spans
a large enough area that it warrants a more thorough discussion than can be given in
this post series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the following terms will be used throughout the series:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input set - A collection of information that is provided to the pipeline to start
the process of turning these generating the desired artefacts. An input set may consist
of source code, e.g. in terms of a given commit to the source control system, files or
documents, configuration values or any other combination of information which is required
to create, validate and deploy the product artefacts.
An input set should contain all the information needed to generate and deploy the product
artefacts and each time a specific input set is provided to the pipeline exactly the
same artefacts will be produced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Executor - In general the development pipeline will be driven by a continuous integration
system which itself consists of a controlling unit, which receives the tasks and distributes them,
and a set of executing units which perform the actual computational tasks. In small systems
the controlling unit may also perform the computational tasks, however even in this case
a distinction can be made between the controlling and executing parts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to start the selection of suitable components for a development pipeline
it is important to know what the desirable properties of such a system are. The following
ordered properties are thought to be the most important ones to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="Software-development-pipeline-Design-accuracy.html"&gt;Accurate&lt;/a&gt;: The pipeline must return the right
outputs for a specific input, i.e it should report errors to the interested parties if there are any
and report success and produce the desired artefacts if there are no errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="Software-development-pipeline-Design-performance.html"&gt;Performance&lt;/a&gt;: The pipeline must push changes
through the different stages fast in order to get results back to the interested parties as soon
as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="Software-development-pipeline-Design-resilience.html"&gt;Resilience&lt;/a&gt;: The pipeline must be able to
cope with environmental changes, both expected and unexpected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="Software-development-pipeline-Design-flexibility.html"&gt;Flexibility&lt;/a&gt;: The pipeline must be easy to
adapt to new products and tools so that it can be used without having to replace large parts each
time a new product or tool needs to be included.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are of course other desirable properties for a development pipeline like ease-of-use,
maintainability, etc.. It is however considered that the aforementioned properties are the
most critical ones. The linked posts provide additional reasons why each of these properties
are important and how a software development pipeline can be designed to satisfy these important
considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Edits&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;August 30th 2017: Replaced the term &lt;code&gt;correctness&lt;/code&gt; with the term &lt;code&gt;accuracy&lt;/code&gt; because that
is a better description of the combined concepts of consistency and correctness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September 4th 2017: Added the link to the post providing the high level description on
how to achieve accuracy for a development pipeline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nobember 5th 2017: Replaced the term &lt;code&gt;robustness&lt;/code&gt; with the term &lt;code&gt;resilience&lt;/code&gt; because it
captures a broader perspective on the ability of the system to handle expected and unexpected
changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

nBuildKit release - V0.10.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="post-meta"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
Sunday, July 16, 2017
 |         Posted in                     &lt;a id="post-category" role="button" href="/tags/nbuildkit" class="btn btn-default btn-xs"&gt;nBuildKit&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div id="post-content"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Version &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/releases/tag/0.10.0"&gt;0.10.0&lt;/a&gt;
and version &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/releases/tag/0.10.1"&gt;0.10.1&lt;/a&gt;
of &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild"&gt;nBuildKit&lt;/a&gt;
have been released. The &lt;code&gt;0.10.0&lt;/code&gt; release is the first release in the stabilization
cycle. There are still a few major changes but the goal is to start stabilizing nBuildKit
in preparation for the 1.0.0 release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlights are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/308"&gt;Renamed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;DirTest&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;DirTests&lt;/code&gt;.
This is a &lt;em&gt;breaking&lt;/em&gt; change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/248"&gt;meta data&lt;/a&gt; can
be provided with the build, test and deploy steps to indicate if a step should be inserted
before or after another step in the sequence. Steps which have no insertion limits, i.e
those steps that do not have the before or after meta data set, are inserted in document order.
Steps that do define insertion limits are inserted according to the limits. Note that
circular limits are not allowed as well as step sequences where there are no steps without
insertion limits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploying artefacts to an &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/303"&gt;HTTP server&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initial implementation of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/296"&gt;ability to verify GPG hash signatures&lt;/a&gt;.
The current implementation requires that the GPG tooling is allowed through the firewall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the major changes some additional build, test and deploy steps have also been defined:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Addition of properties that indicate &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/304"&gt;which stage the script is currently executing&lt;/a&gt;. The
new properties are &lt;code&gt;IsBuild&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;IsTest&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;IsDeploy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allowing &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/306"&gt;template variables&lt;/a&gt; in the
path and &lt;code&gt;destination&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;ArchiveFilesToCopy&lt;/code&gt; item group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Migrated the &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/297"&gt;hash calculation functions&lt;/a&gt;
from &lt;a href="https://github.com/ops-resource/ops-tools-build"&gt;Ops-Tools-Build&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;a href="https://github.com/ops-resource/ops-tools-build"&gt;Ops-Tools-Build&lt;/a&gt; toolkit was released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release was focussed on providing the capabilities to use the Docker toolset to create new
containers and to run validation of VM resources generated by &lt;a href="https://packer.io"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt;.
All the work items that have been closed for this release can be found on

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ops-resource/ops-tools-build/issues/33"&gt;33&lt;/a&gt; - Added the ability to
create ISO files during the test stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ops-resource/ops-tools-build/issues/24"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt; - Added functions to invoke
docker to create container resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ops-resource/ops-tools-build/issues/32"&gt;32&lt;/a&gt; - Added functions to validate
a &lt;a href="https://packer.io"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt; image by executing packer with the previously created image and
executing tests during the packer test build.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ops-resource/ops-tools-build/issues/5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; - A new function which provides
the ability to execute &lt;a href="https://github.com/sethvargo/chefspec"&gt;ChefSpec&lt;/a&gt; tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ops-resource/ops-tools-build/issues/6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; - A new function which
invokes the Chef linting tool &lt;a href="http://www.foodcritic.io/"&gt;Foodcritic&lt;/a&gt; on the selected Chef cookbooks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ops-resource/ops-tools-build/issues/7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt; - A new function which invokes the
Ruby linting tool &lt;a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop"&gt;RuboCop&lt;/a&gt; on selected Ruby source files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ops-resource/ops-tools-build/issues/20"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt; - A new package restore script
was added to allow restoring Chef cookbooks via &lt;a href="https://github.com/berkshelf/berkshelf"&gt;Berkshelf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ops-resource/ops-tools-build/issues/21"&gt;21&lt;/a&gt; - A new switch was added to the
packer function which allows keeping the resources generated with packer in case the packer
build fails. This improves the ability to debug issues in the packer build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

nBuildKit release - V0.9.2&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
Sunday, May 14, 2017
 |         Posted in                     &lt;a id="post-category" role="button" href="/tags/nbuildkit" class="btn btn-default btn-xs"&gt;nBuildKit&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div id="post-content"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Version &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/releases/tag/0.9.2"&gt;0.9.2&lt;/a&gt;
of &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild"&gt;nBuildKit&lt;/a&gt; has been released. This release fixes
a number of bugs and adds a few new improvements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the work items that have been closed for this release can be found on
&lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/milestone/31?closed=1"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bugs fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/280"&gt;280&lt;/a&gt; - The &lt;code&gt;deploy.pushto.gitbranch&lt;/code&gt;
script called the &lt;code&gt;GitCurrentBranch&lt;/code&gt; task with a &lt;code&gt;WorkingDirectory&lt;/code&gt; property which did not exist,
thus causing the pushing to a git branch deployment step to fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/281"&gt;281&lt;/a&gt; - The &lt;code&gt;deploy.pushto.gitbranch&lt;/code&gt;
script did not create the directory into which the repository should be cloned. This caused the
step to fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/286"&gt;286&lt;/a&gt; - The &lt;code&gt;GenerateTargetsFile&lt;/code&gt; custom
task applied a custom assembly resolver which did not resolve references to the MsBuild assemblies.
This is a problem for MsBuild 15.0 and higher because from that version onwards the MsBuild assemblies,
e.g. &lt;code&gt;Microsoft.Build.XX&lt;/code&gt; are no longer located in the GAC and can thus not be found by the standard
assembly resolver.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/287"&gt;287&lt;/a&gt; - The &lt;code&gt;shared.prepare.copy.files&lt;/code&gt;
task did not correctly copy the directory hierarchy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/290"&gt;290&lt;/a&gt; - The &lt;code&gt;build.prepare.generatefiles&lt;/code&gt;
script only generated the files if they did not exist. This has been changed so that generated
files are always created and updated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/254"&gt;254&lt;/a&gt; - All warnings and errors have been
given a proper error code for easier parsing of errors from the log.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/282"&gt;282&lt;/a&gt; - The Git, Powershell and NuGet
base tasks have been moved to the Core targets assembly so that they can be used in third party
custom tasks as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/284"&gt;284&lt;/a&gt; - A new task has been added that
allows extracting files from one or more ZIP archive files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/285"&gt;285&lt;/a&gt; - Additional conditions have been
added to all &lt;code&gt;ItemGroup&lt;/code&gt; elements to ensure that these item groups are only loaded when they are
required. This reduces build times and improves stability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/288"&gt;288&lt;/a&gt; - A new task has been added that
allows downloading files from a HTTP URL. If the file in question is an archive file it can
additionally be unzipped before the final copy takes place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally the first steps to better documentation have been taken. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/blob/master/README.md"&gt;readme&lt;/a&gt;,
the &lt;a href="http://nbuildkit.github.io/nBuildKit.MsBuild/"&gt;introduction&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://nbuildkit.github.io/nBuildKit.MsBuild/docs/contributing"&gt;contributing&lt;/a&gt;
documents have been updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div id="post-content"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Last week version &lt;a href="https://github.com/ops-resource/ops-tools-build/releases/tag/0.1.0"&gt;0.1.0&lt;/a&gt; of the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/ops-resource/ops-tools-build"&gt;Ops-Tools-Build&lt;/a&gt; toolkit was released. With the recent
&lt;a href="./posts/nBuildKit-release-V091"&gt;0.9.1 release of nBuildKit&lt;/a&gt; version &lt;a href="https://github.com/ops-resource/ops-tools-build/releases/tag/0.1.1"&gt;0.1.1&lt;/a&gt;
of the Ops-Tools-Build toolkit was released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the work items that have been closed for this release can be found on
&lt;a href="https://github.com/ops-resource/ops-tools-build/milestone/1?closed=1"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New functionality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ops-resource/ops-tools-build/issues/3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; - New scripts have been added to allow
the creation of an ISO file using the &lt;a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tumagcc"&gt;MakeIsoFS&lt;/a&gt; command
line application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ops-resource/ops-tools-build/issues/4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; - New scripts have been added to allow
invocation of the &lt;a href="https://www.packer.io/"&gt;packer&lt;/a&gt; command line tool used to generate VM and
container images from a set of configuration files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ops-resource/ops-tools-build/issues/10"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; - New scripts were added to allow
calculation of the hash of one or more files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

nBuildKit release - V0.9.1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="post-meta"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
Sunday, April 9, 2017
 |         Posted in                     &lt;a id="post-category" role="button" href="/tags/nbuildkit" class="btn btn-default btn-xs"&gt;nBuildKit&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div id="post-content"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hot on the heels of the last release version &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/releases/tag/0.9.1"&gt;0.9.1&lt;/a&gt;
of &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild"&gt;nBuildKit&lt;/a&gt; has been released. This release fixes
two bugs and adds a few internal improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the work items that have been closed for this release can be found on
&lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/milestone/29?closed=1"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bugs fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/273"&gt;273&lt;/a&gt; - The &lt;code&gt;CalculateSemanticVersionWithGitVersion&lt;/code&gt;
task used the current directory as the working directory. While that is correct in most cases
there are some cases, especially when running the integration tests, where that is not correct.
This has been fixed by requiring the specification of the working directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/277"&gt;277&lt;/a&gt; - In the same way all NuGet tasks
now need a working directory specified in order to make sure that the correct workspace is used
when interacting with the NuGet command line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/272"&gt;272&lt;/a&gt; - The
&lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/blob/master/src/tests/TestFunctions.PrepareWorkspace.ps1"&gt;TestFunctions.PrepareWorkspace.ps1&lt;/a&gt;
and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/blob/master/src/tests/TestFunctions.Git.ps1"&gt;TestFunctions.Git.ps1&lt;/a&gt;
have been updated with additional functions and checks so that when creating a test workspace the
existing git flow process is only completed if the specified branch exists on the remote. This changes
the completion of the git flow process from mandatory to optional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally the &lt;code&gt;IsMasterBranch&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;IsDevelopBranch&lt;/code&gt; properties have been defined in the settings
file. These two properties indicate whether or not the current branch is the &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt;
branch respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/69"&gt;69&lt;/a&gt; - The documentation for nBuildKit itself
is being moved from the wiki to a GitHub pages website. As of this release the build for nBuildKit
will generate the website using &lt;a href="https://wyam.io"&gt;Wyam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div id="post-content"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A little while back we finally got fibre in our street. After spending many years on ADSL (we don't
talk about the time of dial-up ...) it was finally time for some decent network speeds at home. As
the fibre was being installed in my house it was also time to evaluate the networking gear I was
using. Until now I had always used the modem / router provided by the ISP with an additional cheap
switch. The gear always worked fine, but didn't provide configuration options other than the ones that
describe the connection to the ISP. As I was starting to use my &lt;a href="./posts/Updating-Hyper-v-server-to-Windows2016"&gt;Hyper-V server&lt;/a&gt;
a lot more and was starting to run multiple VM's it would be nice to get some better control over
the network. Additionally based on one of &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/no-you-cant-join-my-wifi-network/"&gt;Troy Hunt's&lt;/a&gt;
blog posts I would also like to set up a separate guest network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The selection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prolific Troy Hunt has written about his &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/ubiquiti-all-the-things-how-i-finally-fixed-my-dodgy-wifi/"&gt;network&lt;/a&gt;
setup so I used that as my starting point for finding some new network gear. Fortunately (or unfortunately)
I don't have as much area to cover as Troy does so I didn't need nearly as much hardware. The parts
I got are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ubnt.com/unifi-routing/usg/"&gt;Unifi security gateway&lt;/a&gt;: The router which provides amongst
other things a firewall, subnet capabilities and DHCP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ubnt.com/unifi-switching/unifi-switch-8/"&gt;Unifi switch 8 (US-8-60W)&lt;/a&gt;: The managed switch
which has 4 &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet"&gt;PoE&lt;/a&gt; ports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ubnt.com/unifi/unifi-ap-ac-lite/"&gt;Unifi AP AC LITE&lt;/a&gt;: The smallest indoor access point
available from Ubiquiti. Given that my apartment is relatively small I don't have to worry about
covering a lot of area, and smaller access points are cheaper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ubnt.com/unifi/unifi-cloud-key/"&gt;Unifi cloud key&lt;/a&gt;: The management device which runs
the Unfi software for managing the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for the cloud key this is pretty much the minimal set of hardware required. The cloud key runs
the unifi software which is used to manage the network configuration. You can install the unifi
software on a PC but then you need an extra PC or VM running. While I have a Hyper-V server it was easier
just to pay for the cloud key and have a separate controller for the network. Note that the network
functions just fine without any configuration. However if you want to make changes the easiest way
to do so is through the unifi software, although you could do it by SSH-ing into each device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing to note is that the the 60W switch has 4 PoE ports of the 802.3af kind. Unfortunately
the access point requires 24V passive PoE. So either you have to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power the access point of the converter that you get with the access point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgrade the access point to the &lt;a href="https://www.ubnt.com/unifi/unifi-ap-ac-pro/"&gt;UAP-AC-PRO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgrade the switch to the &lt;a href="https://www.ubnt.com/unifi-switching/unifi-switch-8-150w/"&gt;US-8-150W&lt;/a&gt;
switch which has both 802.3af PoE and 24V passive PoE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as I would like to power the access point of the switch I still opted for the first option,
the additional investment wasn't quite worth having one less cable around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual configuration was pretty easy, plug in all the parts and things start working, at least
for the internal network. Once this is done you can configure the network through the unifi software.
To do so the first thing to do is to to find the cloud key. There's a useful plugin for
&lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ubiquiti-device-discovery/hmpigflbjeapnknladcfphgkemopofig?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog"&gt;chrome&lt;/a&gt;
that allows you to find any Ubiquiti devices on your local network, otherwise you can try to guess
the IP address of the cloud key. If you only have 4 devices like I do that shouldn't take very long.
The gateway by default assumes you are using the &lt;code&gt;192.168.1.0/24&lt;/code&gt; subnet and the gateway is always
the first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are logged on to the unifi software it makes sense to give the cloud key a fixed IP address
I gave mine the 192.168.1.2 IP address as I am using the &lt;code&gt;192.168.1.1/24&lt;/code&gt; subnet for all my networking
gear. And yes I know I don't have enough networking devices for them to warrant being on their own
subnet but it makes things a little easier and it allows me to learn about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork"&gt;subnetting&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN"&gt;vlans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Subnetting adventures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the introduction one of the changes I wanted to make was to create a separate guest
network. By default a vlan only guest network is created, however I wanted to move the guests onto
their own subnet so I created a new network with the &lt;code&gt;192.168.5.1/24&lt;/code&gt; subnet. I also set the vlan
specifier to &lt;code&gt;1685&lt;/code&gt;. And finally I marked this network as a guest network so that the controller
applies the guest firewall rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I created a wireless guest network with the same vlan. What confused me initially is that there
is no relation between the wireless network and the subnet other than the vlan tag. Somehow having the
same vlan tag is enough to direct the clients onto the the correct subnet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last step of the configuration of the guest network is to configure the switch. Because the
access point has three different subnets going to it, the managment subnet for the access point itself,
the guest wifi and the internal wifi, you need to create a custom ‘network’ on the switch which carries
all three networks, making sure that the untagged network is the one on which you want the access
point to get an IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another item I found was that for some purposes the standard IP lease of 24 hours is a bit long. One
of the things I'm currently working on is building VM images of different services for use in a test
build environment. While doing that I'm creating &lt;a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse"&gt;base boxes&lt;/a&gt; for
Windows and Linux which involves spinning up a VM, installing the OS, configuring it and capturing
the image. While working on the code to automate this process I spin up and shut down VMs quite a lot.
If you're using the gateway as the DHCP server and use the standard IP lease time then you run through
IP addresses quite quickly. So I created have a separate IP subnet for those VMs where the IP lease
time is 2 hours (which is more than long enough to create a VM and capture a base image).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In the end&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion it's a good set of hardware and software and as a bonus, there are updates which apply
without problems. There is something reassuring in the fact that the manufacturer actually cares enough
about their product that they want to keep it running, unlike much of the consumer gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unifi software provides a lot of useful and interesting capabilities and it's obviously aimed
at the business / educational environment. There are a lot of of features that I don't need, but they
are fun to play with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
nBuildKit release - V0.9.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="post-meta"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
Monday, April 3, 2017
 |         Posted in                     &lt;a id="post-category" role="button" href="/tags/nbuildkit" class="btn btn-default btn-xs"&gt;nBuildKit&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div id="post-content"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Version &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/releases/tag/0.9.0"&gt;0.9.0&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild"&gt;nBuildKit&lt;/a&gt;
has been released. The last release I talked about on this blog was &lt;a href="posts/nBuildKit-release-V051"&gt;0.5.1&lt;/a&gt;.
Since then a &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/releases"&gt;lot more versions&lt;/a&gt; have been
released. The &lt;code&gt;0.9.0&lt;/code&gt; release was supposed to be a stabilization release but there were many major
improvements which makes this a major change release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlights are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The settings describing artefacts, e.g. the nuspec and zip archive files to build, have moved to
a &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/215"&gt;separate file&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;artefacts.settings.props&lt;/code&gt;.
This allows each of the different stages, build, test and release, to easily use these settings
without having to load configuration files from the other stages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All user specific configuration files now have a &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/224"&gt;version number&lt;/a&gt;
which indicates for which version of nBuildKit they were created. This will allow nBuildKit to
transform older configuration files prior to using them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The inline tasks have been &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/230"&gt;moved to a .NET assembly&lt;/a&gt;.
This simplifies the project includes that need to be made to get all the required tasks loaded.
Additionally more complex tasks can be created and &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/234"&gt;unit tests can be written and executed&lt;/a&gt;
which should improve the quality of the tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/191"&gt;defined location&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/192"&gt;transformation&lt;/a&gt; of the configuration
files prior to starting the build. In combination with the version numbers in the configuration
files this allows nBuildKit to use configuration files from a previous version while still using
the most recent version of nBuildKit. Note that it is currently not possible to upgrade the old
(0.8.3 and prior) configurations to 0.9.0 this way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build, test and deploy steps can define &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/196"&gt;pre- and post-steps&lt;/a&gt;
which are executed before and after the execution of the step. Additionally global pre- and post-steps
can be defined which areo executed before and after each step. These pre- and post-steps can for
instance be used to &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/185"&gt;write information to a log file&lt;/a&gt;
or to gather post step information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/206"&gt;build server specific code&lt;/a&gt; was
moved into separate NuGet packages so that these can be pulled down on the build server only. Three
different packages have been created for &lt;a href="https://jenkins.io/"&gt;Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms181709%28v=vs.120%29.aspx?f=255&amp;amp;MSPPError=-2147217396"&gt;TFS2013&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/build/overview"&gt;TFS2015 / TFS2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The layout of the scripts and NuGet packages has changed so that it is easier to create a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/220"&gt;new set of build tools based on nBuildKit&lt;/a&gt;.
With this change it is now possible to create a build / test / deploy library that includes all or
some of the nBuildKit capabilities while providing its own additional capabilities. An example is
the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ops-resource/ops-tools-build"&gt;ops-tools-build&lt;/a&gt; library which is being used
in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_Code"&gt;infrastructure-as-code&lt;/a&gt; work I'm doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the major changes some additional build, test and deploy steps have also been defined:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete a &lt;a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow"&gt;gitflow&lt;/a&gt;
stage, e.g. finishing the feature, hotfix or release branch, to verify that the pending merge will
not break the build. Additionally the results of the merge can be captured, by archiving the
&lt;code&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt; folder, and can later be used in the deploy process to push the merge to a git remote.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/255"&gt;Copying files&lt;/a&gt; from the file system or
from a NuGet package.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/238"&gt;ILMerge&lt;/a&gt; one or more assemblies into a
target assembly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generating a targets file from an assembly containing MsBuild tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/146"&gt;Invoking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://wyam.io"&gt;Wyam&lt;/a&gt;
during the build process. Note that this is a late addition and hasn't been tested completely yet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invoking &lt;a href="https://github.com/pester/Pester"&gt;Pester&lt;/a&gt; during the test phase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pushing files to a git branch during the deploy stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pushing an entire repository to a git remote during the deploy stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally the performance of the whole build process has been improved by changing how the template
tokens are &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/242"&gt;generated and loaded&lt;/a&gt;. The
overall speed up for the nBuildKit build itself is about a factor two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the work items that have been closed for this release can be found on
&lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/milestone/26?closed=1"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;One of the computers I have in my home is a Hyper-V server which I use to experiment with all things
virtual machines, e.g. &lt;a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/infrastructure-code-reason-smile"&gt;infrastructure-as-code&lt;/a&gt;.
This server was until recently running Windows 2012R2 with the associated version of Hyper-V. With
the release of Windows 2016 a new version of Hyper-V was available which had some interesting
features, like &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/nested-virtualization"&gt;nested virtualization&lt;/a&gt;
which allows running VMs on VMs and running Hyper-V containers. All in all enough interesting features
to warrant upgrading my server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are however some issues to deal with. The first one being, which version of Windows 2016 are
we going to install? The ideal version to install would be the &lt;a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/hyper-v-server-docs/hyper-v-server-2016?f=255&amp;amp;MSPPError=-2147217396"&gt;bare metal Hyper-V&lt;/a&gt;
option with &lt;a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server-docs/get-started/windows-server-2016"&gt;Windows 2016 server Core&lt;/a&gt;
being the second best option. The problem with these version is that it might be harder to
configure the network and attach the machine to the active directory. I currently don't have enough
experience managing Windows through (remote) powershell in order to be able to resolve those kinds
of issues without a large amount of help from Google or Bing. The goal for this exercise is to get
the machine updated so that we can use it, not to get the most lean version of Windows installed, so
I opted to go for the full GUI version of Windows 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make things more interesting my Active Directory server is a VM running on the Hyper-V server.
And yes I know there should be at least two Active Directory servers on different physical machines
but until I have lots of money and can afford to have multiple servers in my house I will work
with having a single AD server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach I followed to upgrade the operating system on my server to Windows 2016 was as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make backups of everything and be ready to spend some time restoring the AD server, i.e. this is
probably better done as a weekend job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/windows-usb-dvd-download-tool"&gt;bootable USB&lt;/a&gt;
with the Windows2016 installer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attach a keyboard, mouse and monitor to the server so that we can log in to the server directly.
Installing Windows remotely is not possible with my local configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert the USB drive, reboot the server and make sure it boots from the USB key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the Windows installation starts make sure to remove the existing partitions on the original
OS drive. While the OS could be upgraded that also leaves a lot of unused files around. Unfortunately
in that case it will be hard to determine if these files can be deleted or not. By doing a clean
install we can be sure that there will not be any left-overs from the upgrade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the new operating system is installed the next step is to restore the VMs. Because all the
VM information was stored on physically different disks than the OS disk all the virtual hard drives
and VM configuration files still exist. In this case it is easy to import the old virtual machines
via the Hyper-V manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once all the VMs were up and running again the last step was to attach the Hyper-V machine to the
domain so that it is easy to use the remote desktop capabilities. Now attaching the machine to
the domain is easy, the problem occurs when you have to restart the Hyper-V machine because after
the reboot the network connection will be set to the public profile instead of the domain profile
which means remote desktop and friends are all blocked. This is all caused by the fact that when the
Hyper-V machine boots up it doesn't have connection to the AD server, because that is a VM running
on the Hyper-V machine, and thus the network profile is set to be public for security purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to fix this we need to either force the &lt;a href="https://newsignature.com/articles/network-location-awareness-service-can-ruin-day-fix/"&gt;Network Location Awareness service&lt;/a&gt; to run
after the AD server has started, or we need to restart the service after a short period. In my case
setting the service start in delayed mode didn't really work so I created a scheduled task which
restarted the service by calling the following command line&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -noprofile -nologo -command "restart-service nlasvc -force"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over all the upgrade was easier than I thought and there were only minor set backs. Some of the lessons
that were learned are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideally for jobs like this you would have an extra keyboard, mouse and monitor around, that way you
can still use the normal PC for googling issues that you come across.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importing old VMs in Hyper-V is easy as long as you make sure that you know where all the files
are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideally you would have multiple AD servers, running of different physical machines. Then again
ideally I'd also have lots of money to pay for all these physical machines 😉&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

 |         Posted in                     &lt;a id="post-category" role="button" href="/tags/appveyor" class="btn btn-default btn-xs"&gt;AppVeyor&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div id="post-content"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One part of &lt;a href="/posts/Goals-for-2017"&gt;improving my career and increasing my professional reach&lt;/a&gt; is to
post more to this blog about the work that I am doing and the code and skills that come from this
work. Unfortunately at the moment writing is still more of a chore than it is a pleasure so that
means that if I want to publish more I need to make it very easy for me to do so, otherwise the publishing
process will just add yet another obstacle that I need to get past while producing content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With me being a build engineer by profession the obvious solution was not to follow the
&lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/its-a-new-blog/"&gt;sensible path&lt;/a&gt; of a managed system but to create some
kind of build system to automatically build and publish my blog posts. Troy Hunt is right in
that a managed system is far quicker and easier to use, thereby saving time that you can use for
improvements elsewhere. In my case however I feel that there is something additional to be gotten from
setting my blog up to be automatically build and deployed. To be specific additional learning experiences,
more knowledge and a new blog post about how I achieved the goal. I hope that those things will
make up for the extra work I have to do in maintaining my own blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the goals for this project were&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build every time I push to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/pvandervelde/mindvortex"&gt;source repository&lt;/a&gt; on
an independent environment so that I can be sure that I can always build my blog and nothing is
dependent on my machine being available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publishing should involve a minimal amount of work done from my side. Ideally all I would have to
do is commit my changes, merge them to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/pvandervelde/mindvortex"&gt;master branch&lt;/a&gt;
of the source repository and then sit back and see the new post appear online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No maintenance is necessary for what ever system I use to achive this goal. When I build new versions
of one of my libraries, applications or infrastructure resources I want full control over the
build, test and deployment environments. For building my blog that is far less important because
it is a simple process which does not require many different steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally it would be nice to make it interesting enough to get a blog post out of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few hours of tinkering that is where we are now, this blog post was build and published
using a combination of &lt;a href="https://www.appveyor.com/"&gt;AppVeyor&lt;/a&gt; as the build server and
&lt;a href="/projects/nBuildKit"&gt;nBuildKit&lt;/a&gt; for the build and deploy scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to achieve this the first step that I took was to set up the build scripts so that I could
build on my local machine. Having a build that executes in the same way on a developer machine
and the build server has many benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity: developers understand what the build server does because it works exactly as on their
machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ease of debugging: it is easier to discover the source of any errors if you can execute the scripts
on a developers machine because then you have have full access to the workspace which may not be
the case on a build machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ease of testing: even build scripts need to be tested. If this is done on a developer machine then
the testing will most likely be able to be executed much quicker because there is less need to
commit every change, push it to the server and wait for the build server to execute the build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configuring &lt;code&gt;nBuildKit&lt;/code&gt; means copying the &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/tree/master/src/samples"&gt;sample files&lt;/a&gt;
to the root of the workspace and updating them with values relevant to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case I updated the &lt;code&gt;settings.props&lt;/code&gt; file, which contains the general information about the
build, test and deploy processes, with &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/88aa8f644148b4cdb9fa909fe3ff8f69"&gt;product information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/9853b15889ccf67bafa5fa2e93594ca2"&gt;enabled the automatic merging&lt;/a&gt;
for the &lt;a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/"&gt;GitFlow&lt;/a&gt; process. This allows
nBuildKit to automatically complete feature, hotfix and release branches when running on a build
server so that each build also verifies that the final merge will be successful and the changes will
not break anything after the merge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next file to update was the &lt;code&gt;build.settings.props&lt;/code&gt; file, which describes what needs to be done
during the build process, was updated. The first part of that was to define which &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/015611f5355b07e1b3246ae81bf2ea0a"&gt;steps should be
taken during the build process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear the workspace. While this is not necessary on a build server, after all a fresh workspace
is used for each build, it is necessary on a developer machine because old artefacts may still
be present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that the build server has configured the workspace with the correct source control information.
Many build systems do not perform a full clone at the start of a build but rather get only the
minimal source control information in addition to the source files. This reduces time and IO
demands, especially for repositories with extensive history. Different build systems have a
different approach to what steps exactly are taken. The lack of source control information, e.g.
the state of different branches, or the branch that the current commit is part of, is not a
problem if the only step is to compiling code however issues can occur if the state of the local
workspace is used to determine version numbers or VCS information. In those cases it is better to
ensure that the workspace is in the same state as it was on the developers machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather VCS information like the current commit ID and the branch name. For my blog this information
is embedded in the footer of every page to indicate which commit was build and what version
of the blog you are looking at.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete the active &lt;code&gt;GitFlow&lt;/code&gt; branch, if there is one, by merging the active branch to the
appropriate target branches and adding tags if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get version information with &lt;a href="https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion"&gt;GitVersion&lt;/a&gt;. This
is done after the merge process so that the version number is the release version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/813a19ff4861470ba03591a5ecc4b910"&gt;Build the pages&lt;/a&gt; with Wyam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zip up the generated pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final change to the &lt;code&gt;build.settings.props&lt;/code&gt; file was to enable the generation of the archive
files by &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/d1ec2c78fc560bd20ef1ef7a375eee30"&gt;uncommenting the &lt;code&gt;ArchivePackageSpecs&lt;/code&gt; section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last file to be changed was the &lt;code&gt;deploy.settings.props&lt;/code&gt; file which describes what needs to be
done during the deploy process. As with the &lt;code&gt;build.settings.props&lt;/code&gt; file the first step here was
to select the &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/8ee5a1dc96d0835bb8b3aa6354896ba7"&gt;steps that should be taken during the deploy process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once again ensure that the build server workspace is configured with the correct source control
information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather version information in the same way as was done during the build process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/c6490e33fd73d0f7afc15677a4bf2e8b"&gt;Push the archive files&lt;/a&gt;
to AppVeyor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push the files contained in the archive file to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/pvandervelde/pvandervelde.github.io"&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt;
that contains the generated pages. This was simply done by enabling the &lt;code&gt;DeployStepsPushToGitBranch&lt;/code&gt;
deploy step and &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/9a2dd811faf4d0e56ef3b5069d2e7d3c"&gt;providing information about the repository and branch&lt;/a&gt;
that the files should be pushed to. The commit message for this process currently comes from a text
file in the root of the repository. Ideally there would be some way to discover a decent commit
message, e.g. the name of the most recent post, however many different changes are pushed to the
source repository so selecting the correct commit message is somewhat difficult.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By updating these three files we have provided &lt;code&gt;nBuildKit&lt;/code&gt; with enough information to execute both
the build and deploy processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the build scripts were complete and tested the only thing that remained was to configure
AppVeyor. This can either be done through the &lt;a href="https://www.appveyor.com/docs/build-configuration/"&gt;UI or a YAML file&lt;/a&gt;.
In this case I elected to use the &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/4171a3b81776132e2800a3f9b802fa43"&gt;YAML file&lt;/a&gt;
so that all information describing my build and deployment process would exist in the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to create the configuration file I copied the &lt;a href="https://www.appveyor.com/docs/appveyor-yml/"&gt;reference file&lt;/a&gt;
and then removed all the bits I didn't need. The only tricky bit was setting up the AppVeyor
environment so that the deploy process could push the final results back to GitHub. For that I
added a &lt;a href="https://github.com/blog/2024-read-only-deploy-keys"&gt;deploy key&lt;/a&gt; to the target repository.
The private part of this key was then encrypted and placed in the YAML file. Some &lt;code&gt;before_deploy&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.appveyor.com/docs/how-to/private-git-sub-modules/"&gt;script magic&lt;/a&gt; allows the decryption
of the key so that git can push the changes to the repository via SSH.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

 |         Posted in                     &lt;a id="post-category" role="button" href="/tags/goals" class="btn btn-default btn-xs"&gt;Goals&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div id="post-content"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In 2016 set myself a bunch of goals for the year for different areas of my life. Of all the goals
I only managed to achieve one successfully but am still pretty happy with how the year turned
out. Overall improvements were made and new things were learned so what that concerns it was
a successful year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that setting goals did sort of work for me in 2016 going into 2017 I decided to do this again
and set some goals in order to actively progress in different areas. This time I also decided to
write the goals down somewhere public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2017 my goals are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improve my overall fitness while maintaining my weight at or below 80kg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016 my goal was to improve my fitness and lose some weight. Due to a shoulder and elbow injury
I actually gained weight in the first half of the year but over the course of the last 6 months
I managed to lose about 5kgs thanks to a lot of exercise and an improvement in my eating habits.
As a bonus I gained a lot of strength and general endurance. Overall these improvements have made
me feel a lot better, have a more defined set of muscles and helped me in my outdoor spot pursuits
as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2017 the goal is to keep the weight the same, just below 80kgs, while improving my general
strength and fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make my career independent from my job&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last two years I have been working for &lt;a href="https://vista.co"&gt;Vista&lt;/a&gt; as a software / build engineer
responsible for the development tooling and infrastructure. While this has been a bit of a change
from my previous jobs as software developer it has been a great experience. I have learned about
many new technologies, created some awesome tooling and have many more things still to learn and
create. However with this change from general developer to more of an internal tooling / infrastructure
person it has also become clear to me that my technical capabilities will improve more if I make
my toughts, opinions and code available for public scrutiny by the larger development community.
I already have a &lt;a href="/projects"&gt;number of open source projects&lt;/a&gt; but for 2017 I also plan to write
and potentially speak more about the things I'm working on. One part of that is re-re-activating
my blog and writing new posts about some of the cool technologies I'm currently working with and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simplify life and my surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first few years after I moved to New Zealand I didn't have very much in the way of material
possessions, after all I had just moved to the other side of the world with only the things I could
take on the airplane. Additionally I moved almost every year to a new house so getting rid of
useless possessions meant I had to move less stuff from the old house to the new one. Over time
though I have acquired more things both materially and in habits. Some of those things are
&lt;a href="/tags/paragliding"&gt;highly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="/tags/climbing"&gt;prized&lt;/a&gt; however some things are a waste of time and
space. The goal for 2017 is to minimize the amount of useless stuff I have, like pieces of furniture
which are never used, and useless things I do so that there is  more time and space to spend on
things that are useful and improve my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improve my confidence, in general in life but especially for climbing and paragliding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general in life having confidence in yourself and your skills is important. For my outdoor
activities, climbing and paragliding, it is even more important. Without confidence in yourself and
your skils it is not possible to perform well in either activity. Due to injuries and some
intense experiences my confidence in either my climbing or flying skills isn't very high at the
moment so 2017 is the year that I will do my utmost best to improve my confidence in my professional
skills, my climbing and paragliding capabilities and life in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sports / achievment goals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final goals for 2017, at least as far as this list goes, is to actively improve my skils
in climbing and flying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while I have been trying to improve my climbing skills, strength and endurance enough to
be able to climb a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing)"&gt;grade 24&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_climbing"&gt;sports climb&lt;/a&gt;. So for 2017 that will be my goal, to
improve enoguh to finally be able to climb a 24. Additionally over the last few years I have been
doing more &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_climbing"&gt;trad climbing&lt;/a&gt; I am also going to
try to improve my skills in that area by setting myself a goal of climbing a grade 20 on trad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my other outdoor activity, paragliding, the general goals are related to the distance your
can fly &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragliding#Cross-country_flying"&gt;cross country (XC)&lt;/a&gt;. As I
have so far not managed to get away from launch at all my goal for 2017 is to do an XC flight of
more than 5km.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Wednesday, January 11, 2017
 |         Posted in                     &lt;a id="post-category" role="button" href="/tags/blog" class="btn btn-default btn-xs"&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div id="post-content"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After not having done anything with my blog for over a year I have returned and will once again try
to make this blogging thing happen. Part of my goals for 2017 is to start advancing my career
independent from my job. And one part of that goal is to blog about all the things I'm learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For about a year and a half &lt;a href="http://docpad.org/"&gt;Docpad&lt;/a&gt; has been very helpful in adding content to
my blog, however as I was trying to automate my blog more and more I came to the conclusion that
being on a Windows operating system doesn't make dealing with node and NPM any easier. So I figured
it might make sense to switch to a &lt;a href=""&gt;static generator&lt;/a&gt; which uses technologies that play better on
Windows. Enter &lt;a href="https://wyam.io"&gt;Wyam&lt;/a&gt;, a static generator written in .NET, a technology stack
I'm very familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting started&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started with Wyam I downloaded the latest version and generated a skeleton directory structure
by running the &lt;code&gt;wyam.exe new --recipe Blog&lt;/code&gt; command. Once the skeleton has been created you can
create the pages by running &lt;code&gt;wyam.exe -r Blog -t CleanBlog&lt;/code&gt;, and to create and be able to view
the pages you can execute &lt;code&gt;wyam -r Blog -t CleanBlog -p&lt;/code&gt;. These commands assume that you store
your blog source in the &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; directory and that the website pages should be placed in the
&lt;code&gt;output&lt;/code&gt; directory. This however is where the build engineer in me started making
disapproving sounds so I changed the input and output folders by specifying the appropriate command line
parameters to make it happy again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;wyam.exe --input src --output build\site -r Blog -t CleanBlog -p
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good that is much more inline with the standard paths used by &lt;a href="/projects/nbuildkit"&gt;nBuildKit&lt;/a&gt;.
Another change that needs to be made is where Wyam stores the NuGet packages. Normally Wyam stores
those in a global location, however I strongly feel that builds should always only write to their
local workspaces, so lets redirect the packages to a folder that is local to the workspaces&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;wyam.exe --input src --output build\site --use-local-packages --packages-path packages -r Blog -t CleanBlog -p
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That command line is getting longer but we can make it shorter again by moving some of the
standard items into the &lt;a href="https://wyam.io/docs/usage/configuration"&gt;Wyam configuration file&lt;/a&gt;, so
I created a &lt;code&gt;config.wyam&lt;/code&gt; file in the root of the workspace and added the following lines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Preprocessor directives
#recipe Blog
#theme CleanBlog
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with this the command line to generate the website and start a local webserver is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;wyam.exe --input src --output build\site --use-local-packages --packages-path packages
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Moving the existing content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving the existing content from the Docpad generated site to the Wyam generated site required a bit
of work although the initial results were quite easy to achieve. I started off moving the
post files to the &lt;code&gt;posts&lt;/code&gt; directory and updating all the files to be named so that Wyam is able
to extract the date and time from the file name. In order for that to work Wyam wants the file
name to follow the naming convention &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;YEAR&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;MONTH&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;DAY&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;TITLE&amp;gt;.md&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was to update the front matter in the post files. Wyam would like to see the
following format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Title: &amp;lt;POST_TITLE_GOES_HERE&amp;gt;
Tags:
  - &amp;lt;TAG_1&amp;gt;
  - &amp;lt;TAG_2&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this done Wyam can generate a website with blog posts with the correct titles and dates. This
is a good start. Next are the non-post pages, like the &lt;a href="/"&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="/projects"&gt;project pages&lt;/a&gt;.
These can simply be dropped in the desired directory. Wyam will automatically generate HTML pages
from any Markdown file and simply copy the other files (like the favicon etc.). Any non-blog post
pages will show up in the menu bar so for all pages that should not show up in the menu bar you can
add the &lt;code&gt;ShowInNavBar: false&lt;/code&gt; entry in the page front matter like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Title: My page that shouldn't show up in the NavBar
ShowInNavBar: false
---
# Content
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once that was done I created &lt;a href="https://wyam.io/recipes/blog/themes"&gt;overrides&lt;/a&gt; for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The page and post footers by creating the &lt;code&gt;_Footer.cshml&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_PostFooter.cshtml&lt;/code&gt; files. The page
footer was straight forward but the post footer required some additional work to get the links
to the previous and next post to function correctly. Fortunately &lt;a href="https://daveaglick.com/"&gt;Dave Glick&lt;/a&gt;
was very helpful on the &lt;a href="https://gitter.im/Wyamio/Wyam"&gt;gitter&lt;/a&gt; page for Wyam and pointed out
that there are collections that you can iterate over to find out what the previous and
next posts are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/d2825f2c5d67ab30d15ce179ced4b30f.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sidebar which contains my little ‘about me’ blurp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The navbar which by default orders pages alphabetically and does not contain a link to the home page.
In my Docpad blog both those things are not true, so I did a bit of Razor coding and generated the
navbar items myself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/7645c478ae08c94d3716ca8e8ad41c4c.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These changes got most of the pages looking pretty close to what they should be, but yet not quite
the same as it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tweaking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't have an existing layout for your blog or you don't mind changing the layout then
after the previous steps you should have a very nice looking blog that works just fine. However it
turns out I'm stuborn and specific in the way I want things to look. In this case I wanted my blog
to not look any different than the existing one does, at least for the time being. So that meant
I had to do a fair amount of tweaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first major tweak was to get the sidebar looking like it should. This turned out to be a little
harder than I expected because it required overriding the &lt;code&gt;_Layout.cshtml&lt;/code&gt; page. While this is a
bigger step than the other overrides it also meant I was able to make the pages look exactly like
I wanted and I was able to re-use my CSS files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/5e3520e0f150176f529b1972fc2042a7.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more tricky parts was to generate a list of the last 10 posts. Originally I was using
the list of posts, however because this is the layout page that is used for all pages it might
well be that some pages are generated before the full post list is available (say hello to the
&lt;a href="/tags"&gt;tags&lt;/a&gt; pages). Once again Dave Glick came through and pointed me to the &lt;a href="https://wyam.io/recipes/blog/pipelines"&gt;RawPosts&lt;/a&gt;
collection which is generated right at the beginning of the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the issues with the sidebar were resolved the next step was to show the last five blog posts
on the home page. By default Wyam will place excepts on the home page with a link to the actual post
in the post title. However what I wanted was the full post, excluding the comment section. Once again
the &lt;code&gt;RawPosts&lt;/code&gt; collection came to the rescue which allowed me to iterate over the last five posts
and get their pre-rendered content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/d0d83eb2c636a5d3b63b5bf0cce6029c.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some additional hacking also allowed me to reuse the &lt;code&gt;_PostHeader.cshtml&lt;/code&gt; file for both the posts
on the home page, for which the title links to the actual post page, and for the post page in which
the title is just a header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/465c0a2399f135a25e656b0d15c1866a.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these changes the blog looks (almost) exactly like it used to look except that it is now
being generated by &lt;a href="https://wyam.io"&gt;Wyam&lt;/a&gt;. All in all I have to say I'm pretty happy with the result
and with how easy it was to move from Docpad to Wyam. And as a bonus I understand much more of
how Wyam works and how my own blog is generated.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div id="post-footer"&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
