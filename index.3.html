                    <a id="post-category" href="/tags/pg2.html">PG2</a>
                
            </p>
        </div>

    <div id="post-content">
        <p>Two weeks ago I managed to fulfil another criteria for my PG2 license by flying at the  <a href="http://paraglidingnewzealand.com/places-to-fly/site/mangawhai-heads">Mangawhai Heads</a> for my fifth site. </p>
<p>Unlike the other locations the launch site at Mangawhai heads is rather small, just big enough for the glider. Because of the conditions and the amount of space at the launch location I elected to do a forward launch with some assistance of the instructor. That turned out to be a good decision because as soon as the glider was above my head it caught the wind stream and I rocketed off the ground. Unfortunately with all the pre-launch action going on I had neglected to completely check my glider which meant I ended up with a small line tangle in the top C-D line which slowed my glider down a bit during flight. </p>
<p>After about 20 minutes of flying I started to notice that my ground speed was reducing more and more, at which point I decided it was better to be on the ground wishing I was in the sky than being in the sky wishing I was on the ground and so I landed on the beach.</p>
<p>The learning points of this flight are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reducing the seat depth of my harness has made flying a lot more comfortable, at least for shorter flights. I guess I will see how comfortable it is during longer flights. </li>
<li>The addition of a stir-up makes getting into the harness much easier. All I have to do now is stand up on the stir-up and I&#39;m in the seat. I&#39;m still not used to staying on the stir-up during flight though so I will have to work out what to do with that, especially during turns.</li>
<li>I really should start practising my asymmetrical launches so that I can use those during high wind launch situations to reduce the pressures on the glider and myself during the initial part of the launch.</li>
</ul>

        <p>During the Christmas holidays a few weeks ago I was planning to get lots of flying done, after all I had two weeks off and the weather had been amazing while I was in the office so what else could be the case? Unfortunately it turned out that the weather gods had other plans and provided generous helpings of wind and rain. That meant I only managed to fly on two different days. </p>
<p>However that doesn&#39;t mean that the Christmas holidays were lacking paragliding activities. You see my new <a href="http://www.korteldesign.com/spip/?Karma-II-231">harness</a> arrived just before Christmas. It was ordered three or so months ago but it was completely worth the wait. The build quality is very high and the harness felt comfortable straight away. Mind you there is still some set up to be done. There are a lot of different straps on this harness which subtly change the position and shape of the harness. I suspect it will be a while before I find all the right settings.
The biggest difference so far compared to the school harnesses is that it feels like the harness reacts more to changes in the glider, which at the moment is unsettling but I guess I&#39;ll get used to it. And the second difference is that the harness is harder to get into.   </p>
<p>Given that I was already spending money I figured I should spend some more ... Actually it was more like there were a few other things that were either <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altimeter">legally required</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute">very sensible</a> to have. And so I also bought a <a href="http://www.brauniger.com/en/products/flight-instruments/iq-basic-gps/overview.html">vario</a> and a <a href="http://gingliders.com/rescue-systems/yeti-light-rescue/">reserve</a>. The combination was not cheap but I do feel a lot safer now that I have a way to tell how high I am and a way to come down in case everything goes to custard.</p>
<p>Finally I also did my PG2 theory exam and scored 97% which I was pretty stoked with. The minimum score to pass is 90% so I managed to get that in the bag pretty easily. There is one more theoretical exam to do which is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_flight_rules">VFR</a> exam. For that I am trying to learn all the abbreviations at the moment which might take a bit of time.</p>
<p>All in all the Christmas holidays turned out to have a decent amount of paragliding related activities.</p>

        <p>Once the configuration of <a href="/projects/sherlock.html">Sherlock</a> is complete the last step needed to make use of automatic regression testing is to integrate with a build server. In this post I will explain which steps need to be taken to integrate Sherlock with a build server. Examples will be given for <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a>, which is used at my work, and <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/">TeamCity</a>, which I use personally. </p>
<p>In order to integrate with a build server you will need to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Create at least one test configuration</li>
<li>Write the build scripts necessary to register a test, wait for the completion of the test and process the results.</li>
<li>Set up a job on the build server to execute the test.  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="test-configurations">Test configurations</h3>
<p>In order to execute a test the first thing you need to decide on is the test configuration which will be executed. In Sherlock the test configuration is described by a XML file similar to the following gist: </p>
<script src='https://gist.github.com/8346703.js'></script>

<p>In this configuration file replace all instances of <code>${SOME_TEXT}$</code> with the appropriate information. Note that some configuration settings should be templated so that those values can be supplied by the build system, e.g. the application version number:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide an application name and version for use in the test report.</li>
<li>Provide a compact description. This will be used as the title of the test report</li>
<li>Provide each environment with a name. It doesn&#39;t matter what that name is as long as it is consistently used throughout the configuration file. All test steps which should be executed on the same environment should be linked to the same environment name. Note that while it is possible to request multiple environments to be started in a test, it is not possible to synchronize those environments. In other words each environment will exit as soon as it completes the test steps assigned to it, no environment will wait for other environments to complete their work.</li>
<li>For each test step that needs to be executed provide the order (integer number starting at 0, incrementing for each step), the name of the environment in which the step should be executed, the failure mode, either Stop or Continue and the correct file paths. Note that the test steps use the following definitions for their file paths:<ul>
<li><strong>msi:</strong> <code>file</code> is the absolute path to the MSI file as on the machine that is used to register the test (i.e. the origin).</li>
<li><strong>x-copy:</strong> <code>destination</code> is the absolute path to the directory that will hold all the x-copy results on the test environment.</li>
<li><strong>x-copy:</strong> <code>base</code> is the absolute path to the directory that holds the files / directories to be x-copied on the origin.</li>
<li><strong>x-copy:</strong> <code>paths</code> contains the absolute paths to the files / directories that should be x-copied. It is expected that these all reside in the <code>base</code> directory at some level.</li>
<li><strong>script:</strong> <code>file</code> is the absolute path to the script file on the origin.</li>
<li><strong>console:</strong> <code>exe</code> is the absolute path to the executable that should be executed on the test environment. Note that the path is also pointed to the test environment. Hence the <code>CONSOLE</code> test step is the only test step that doesn&#39;t copy files.</li>
<li><strong>All test steps:</strong> All files and directories that should be included in the report are absolute paths on the test environment.</li>
<li><strong>notification:</strong> The absolute path where the final report should be placed. This path should be accessible to both Sherlock (the master controller) and the application that will process the test results.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It makes sense to always copy back any logs that are written during the test. If you don&#39;t need them for test failure diagnosis then it is easy to delete them later, however you can&#39;t copy them from the test environment after the test has completed because the test environment will be reset to its original state upon shut down. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you need tests to run in different environments or with different test steps then you will need to create a configuration file for each environment / set of test steps.  </p>
<h3 id="build-scripts">Build scripts</h3>
<p>The easiest way to execute the test from a build server is to create a set of build scripts that can do the work for you. In this example I will be using MsBuild as the scripting language.</p>
<p>In order to create the configuration file from the template it is necessary to replace all the templated configuration settings with their current values. The following gist shows an inline MsBuild task that does exactly that:</p>
<script src='https://gist.github.com/8277812.js?file=TemplateFile.xml'></script>

<p>In order to use this task create an <code>ItemGroup</code> with the identifiers of the settings and their replacement values. For example:</p>
<script src='https://gist.github.com/8277812.js?file=HowToUseTemplateFile.xml'></script>

<p>If this example is used on the following template file:</p>
<script src='https://gist.github.com/8277812.js?file=BeforeReplacement.xml'></script>

<p>Then the outcome is the following output file:</p>
<script src='https://gist.github.com/8277812.js?file=AfterReplacement.xml'></script>

<p>The next step will be to create a build script that can register the test with the Sherlock system. This can either be done with a call to the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x8zx72cd.aspx">exec</a> task or with the following inline MsBuild task:</p>
<script src='https://gist.github.com/8346876.js'></script>

<p>The next step is a little tricky in that it is now necessary to wait for Sherlock to execute the test and create the test report. The tricky bit due to the fact that Sherlock will only execute the tests when a suitable test environment is available. That means that tests could be executed almost immediately if an environment is directly available, or not for a long time if all environments are busy. On top of that MsBuild does not have the ability to watch specific files. The following inline task allows you to wait for certain files to be created. Note that you need to provide a time-out which determines how long this task will wait for the report files. How long this time-out should be depends on:</p>
<ul>
<li>How long it takes for the tests to execute.</li>
<li>How many tests will be executed on the same test environments. Tests executing on different test environments can be run in parallel provided the hardware will stand up to it.</li>
<li>How many other tests may potentially be executing at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<script src='https://gist.github.com/8346893.js'></script>

<p>Finally the report files need to be checked for success or failure. For each test Sherlock produces a HTML and an XML report. The easiest way to find the outcome of a test is to parse the XML report and search for the <code>result</code> element. The value of this element will either be <code>Passed</code> or <code>Failed</code>. The following inline task will accomplish this goal:</p>
<script src='https://gist.github.com/8346900.js'></script>

<h3 id="build-jobs">Build jobs</h3>
<p>The final task is to setup one or more build jobs for the build server to execute. While you can combine the testing steps with the build steps it is in general advisable to have a separate job for the testing steps. The main reason for that is that the the testing steps can take quite a while to execute, ranging from several minutes to hours, which slows down the continuous integration feedback cycle considerably. Based on the idea that the tests should be contained in their own build job the following set-up is proposed. </p>
<ul>
<li>Define three different build jobs for the build, test and deploy stages of the process. This means that each job will be responsible for a specific task. Individual jobs will be use the artefacts produced by the other jobs.</li>
<li>Set up dependencies between the different builds where required. For instance the test job will depend on the artefacts produced by the build job.</li>
<li>The build job can be run both as continuous integration build, i.e. execute the build job each time a commit to the source control system is detected, and as pre-requisite to the test job.</li>
<li>Similarly the test job could be run nightly to provide relatively quick feedback on regression problems while also acting as pre-requisite to the deploy job. </li>
<li>If the version number includes either the build counter of the build job or the revision number of the source control commit then special care needs to be taken for the test and deploy jobs in order to ensure that they get the same numbers as the build job did.</li>
<li>In a similar fashion it will be necessary to control the version control settings so that all builds pull in the same revision. One solution would be to store the revision index in the first job in the chain and then transfer that to the other jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the two build systems I have specifically worked with the following additional notes can be made:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a><ul>
<li>In addition to the three standard jobs you will probably need a <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+Flow+Plugin">Build flow</a> job to trigger the different standard jobs in the right order. This has to be done because at the moment it does not seem possible in Jenkins to trigger pre-requisite builds without having the downstream project taking up one of the build executors. The build flow jobs live outside the actual build executors which makes it possible to optimize the use of the executors.</li>
<li>In order to deal with the build number problems as specified above the simplest way is to write the number to a file in the upstream job, archive that and then pull it out in the downstream jobs. The same goes for the version control information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/">TeamCity</a><ul>
<li>Downstream jobs have both a snapshot dependency and an artefact dependency on the upstream job. The <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD8/Configuring+Dependencies">snapshot dependency</a> takes care of the synchronization of the version control revision. Note that you should create different VCS roots for each project, otherwise the projects all share a single check-out directory. By sharing a single directory it is possible that upon starting the second job the directory is cleaned which will likely remove the artefacts from the first job. </li>
<li>The build number can be copied easily by <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD8/Configuring+General+Settings#ConfiguringGeneralSettings-BuildNumberFormat">synchronizing</a> the build numbers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

    <div id="post-content">
        <p>After the configuration of the <a href="/posts/2013-12-10_Setting-up-Sherlock-serverside.html">host machine</a> and the <a href="/posts/2013-12-11_Setting-up-Sherlock-virtualmachines.html">virtual machines</a> the final step in the configuration of Sherlock is to verify that everything is configured correctly. This can be done by using the verification package that comes with each <a href="https://github.com/pvandervelde/Sherlock/releases">release</a> of Sherlock. In order to use the verification package take the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unpack the <strong>verification.zip</strong> package to a directory somewhere (e.g. <code>c:\temp\sherlock</code>).</li>
<li>Update the configuration file <code>Sherlock.VerificationConfiguration.msbuild</code> with the following settings:<ul>
<li><strong>ConfigurationReportDirectory:</strong> The directory where you want the final report to be placed. Note that both the user who requests the test and the user which is used to run the Sherlock services need to have access to this directory. The <code>report</code> directory that was created on the <a href="/posts/2013-12-10_Setting-up-Sherlock-serverside.html">host</a> machine</li>
<li><strong>ConfigurationServerUrl:</strong> The URL of the web service, e.g. <code>http:\\myhostmachine\sherlock.api</code></li>
<li><strong>ConfigurationOperatingSystem:</strong> The operating system name that you want to test with. This needs to match one of the operating systems that has been registered with the management website and which is installed on at least one of your test environments.</li>
<li><strong>ConfigurationOperatingSystemServicePack:</strong> Can be left empty if the operating system has no service pack. If the operating system has a service pack then it needs to match the service pack name of the operating system as registered with the management web site.</li>
<li><strong>ConfigurationOperatingSystemCulture:</strong> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag">culture</a> as defined for the registered operating system.</li>
<li><strong>ConfigurationOperatingSystemPointerSize:</strong> The &#39;bitness&#39; or pointer size for the operating system, either 32 or 64 bits. Should again match the value that was provided when the operating system was registered.</li>
<li><strong>ConfigurationRemotePcWorkingPath:</strong> A path where the test files will be placed on the test environment, e.g. <code>c:\temp</code>.</li>
<li><strong>ConfigurationSherlockConsoleDirectory:</strong> The directory where the console application is installed, this may be a UNC path or a normal directory, e.g. <code>\\MyHostMachine\console</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Execute the <code>Sherlock.ExecuteVerificationTests.msbuild</code> script. This script will prepare the files to be send across (a test application and some test scripts), start the console application, register the test and then wait for the reports to be produced. </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the reports will come back with some errors. The verification was designed this way on purpose to make it possible to test the error handling. In the end there should be three reports, one for each known test configuration version, i.e. v1.0, v1.1 and v1.2. The reports should show the following errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The script execution that executes <code>c:\temp\Sherlock.Verification.Console.exe</code> with the <code>-f</code> command line argument. The <code>-f</code> parameter indicates that the process should &#39;fail&#39; and exit with an exit code of 1.</li>
<li>The script execution for <code>c:\temp\Sherlock.Verfication.Console.exe</code> with parameter <code>-c</code>. The <code>-c</code> parameter indicates that the process should exit with an unhandled exception. The exit code for the process should be -532462766.</li>
<li>The application execution <code>c:\temp\Sherlock.Verification.Console.exe</code> with the <code>-f</code> command line argument. </li>
<li>The application execution for <code>c:\temp\Sherlock.Verfication.Console.exe</code> with parameter <code>-c</code>. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>If there are any problems during the verification then the first thing to look at are the debug logs which are written by the different applications. The logs are generally found in <code>c:\ProgramData\Sherlock\&lt;APP_NAME&gt;\&lt;VERSION&gt;\logs</code>. Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>If there is not enough information in the logs then you can change the log level in the application configuration file under the <code>DefaultLogLevel</code> configuration option. The available levels are (from most verbose to least verbose):<ul>
<li>Trace </li>
<li>Debug</li>
<li>Info</li>
<li>Warn</li>
<li>Error</li>
<li>Fatal</li>
<li>None</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The applications running in the test environment also log but those logs may be removed if the test environment is a virtual machine. However version 1.2 of the test configuration file has the possibly to copy the logs back to the host machine for inclusion into the test report. For this to work set the <code>includesystemlog</code> attribute of the <code>includeinreport</code> element to <code>true</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some standard problems that may occur are mentioned below.</p>
<h4 id="console-and-web-service">Console and web service</h4>
<ul>
<li>If the console application fails to connect to the web service because it cannot find the web service then verify that the web service can be reached. The two main problems that could be the root cause of this are either the web service is not running or the user which started the console application has no access rights to the web service.</li>
<li>If the console application crashes due to a URL problem (see the log file) then it is most likely that you put a partial URL, e.g. <code>mycoolserver\sherlock.api</code> instead of <code>http://mycoolserver/sherlock.api</code>.</li>
<li>If the console successfully manages to go through nearly all the test registration steps but fails on the transfer of the test files then there is quite likely a problem with the web service permissions to write to the <code>App_Data</code> directory.</li>
<li>If the web service fails on the first call then there is quite likely a problem with the database connection. This is most likley either a problem with the connection string or a problem with the permissions. In case of a permission issue check if the user which is running the web service can access the stored procedures in the database.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="update-service">Update service</h4>
<ul>
<li>If the update service is unable to verify the update packages then it is not able to access the public key file. Make sure the configuration file points to the public key file and that this file is reachable by the service.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="master-controller">Master controller</h4>
<ul>
<li>If the master controller fails to connect to the database this could point to either a problem with the connection string or a problem with the permissions. In case of a permissions problem again check that the user running the master controller can access the stored procedures in the database.</li>
<li>If the master controller is unable to start a virtual machine then the <em>SherlockUser</em> may not have <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/virtual_pc_guy/archive/2008/01/17/allowing-non-administrators-to-control-hyper-v.aspx">permissions</a> to start the virtual machines. The log will show this as an error in the environment loading. Probably a security exception.</li>
<li>If the controller is blocked by the firewall, or the firewall on the test environment is blocking, then there will be no communication between the test environment and the host. The log shows this through the fact that the host will wait an excessive amount of time for the remote &#39;endpoint&#39; to connect. A normal start up takes around 2 minutes for a test environment start, operating system load and Sherlock load.</li>
