- Want to have suspension on the wheels so that the wheels can handle small-ish bumps / dips. Not
  expecting this part of the suspension to handle big movements. Mostly want it to handle the smaller
  faster movements.
- Possibly have suspension arms between the wheel assembly and the robot body that can handle
  large movements of the wheels.
- Have to consider where to put the motors etc.. Motors are heavy so we want them on the sprung
  side of the suspension system. Additionally we don't want the motors to be vibrating a lot


- Eventually we may aim to make the suspension system active, so that we can handle extreme terrain
  and even possibly turn it into a wheel-legged robot which can both drive and walk
