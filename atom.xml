            <id>http://pvandervelde.github.io/posts/2013-09-25_How-this-blog-was-created.html</id>
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A long time ago, in a location far, far, far away there was a hero in search for a quest ... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he searched ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he searched .... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And .. oh never mind, our hero he is not the object of this current post, thus we shall be leaving him in some weird limbo looking for his quest... oh well. The topic of this post is how this blog / website was build. It turns out that building anything in HTML, CSS, Node.js and all the other cool web technologies isn&amp;#39;t really my strong suit. However I&amp;#39;m hoping that the description of how I build this site may be useful to somebody at some point in time, if only to have a good laugh at my lack of CSS skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as I love writing code, the idea of writing my content in an angle bracket language didn&amp;#39;t really attract me so the plan was hatched (it came out of a purple egg, by the way) to write (nearly) all content in &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; by using &lt;a href=&quot;http://docpad.org&quot;&gt;Docpad&lt;/a&gt;. Given that I&amp;#39;ve recently started using &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; for my open source projects why not use it for version control and GitHub pages to serve my website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t bore you with the details on how to install Docpad, the Docpad website has an excellent introduction to all those things. Once the initial install is done Docpad allows you to create a skeleton website by executing the following command&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlighted&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;Docpad run&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At which point Docpad presents a list of possible skeletons to use. In my case I selected the &lt;a href=&quot;http://html5boilerplate.com/&quot;&gt;HTML5 boilerplate template&lt;/a&gt;. In order to get a nice layout quickly I also used the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freecsstemplates.org/previews/opentools/&quot;&gt;Open tools&lt;/a&gt; template. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had the basic site layout sorted it was time to focus creating my own sections. Fortunately Docpad has a large number of plugins that provide useful additions to the generation process. For the generation of this site the following plugins are used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/grassator/docpad-plugin-datefromfilename&quot;&gt;datefromfilename&lt;/a&gt; - Extracts the date of a post from the file name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docpad.org/plugin/gist/&quot;&gt;gist&lt;/a&gt; - Adds &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub gists&lt;/a&gt; to a page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docpad.org/plugin/highlightjs/&quot;&gt;highlightjs&lt;/a&gt; - Provides syntax highlighting for code samples. My current plan is to use this for the smaller samples and use GitHub gists for the larger ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lucor/docpad-plugin-navlinks&quot;&gt;navlinks&lt;/a&gt; - Adds navigation links to the bottom of each post, pointing at the previous and next post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docpad.org/plugin/related/&quot;&gt;related&lt;/a&gt; - Allows you to find all related documents based on a given set of tags.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rantecki/docpad-plugin-tagging&quot;&gt;tagging&lt;/a&gt; - Generates the tag cloud for the sidebar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all the toys sorted it was time to integrate them in the templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Menu&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top level menu is based on a collection which contains all pages that have their &lt;code&gt;isPage&lt;/code&gt; flag set to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;. Note that we also assume that these pages have 
the default layout. One thing to note is that the docpad.coffee configuration file seems to be sensitive to the type of whitespace you use. Either use spaces or tabs, but don&amp;#39;t mix them, otherwise you may get some weird errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src='https://gist.github.com/6375681.js?file=collections.pages.docpad.coffee'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the collection has been filled with pages it is used to create an unordered list with an additional highlight placed on the currently active page&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src='https://gist.github.com/6375681.js?file=menu.default.html'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sidebar&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sidebar contains three different sections. The first section is the about section which is nothing special. The &lt;em&gt;recent&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;tags&lt;/em&gt; sections are more interesting from a website construction perspective. The &lt;em&gt;recent&lt;/em&gt; section based on the &lt;em&gt;frontpage&lt;/em&gt; collection which grabs all items from the posts and 
projects subdirectories and then sorts them by date. The &lt;em&gt;recent&lt;/em&gt; section only display the last 10 items in that collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src='https://gist.github.com/6375681.js?file=recent.default.html'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;tags&lt;/em&gt; section is based on a collection provided by the tagging plugin. The font-size of the tag is based on the weight assigned to the tag by the tagging plugin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src='https://gist.github.com/6375681.js?file=tags.default.html'&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Each tag links to a page that contains all the posts that contain that tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Projects, tag indexes and posts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project pages all have a shared layout which provides them with a title and a section that lists all the posts tagged with the name of the project&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src='https://gist.github.com/6375681.js?file=project-linkedposts.html'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Posts are displayed in three different places: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The home page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tag index page, containing all posts with a given tag&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The post page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All pages use the same partial layout file in order to display the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src='https://gist.github.com/6375681.js?file=post-content.html'&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The only difference between the post page and the other pages is that the post page will display all the comments. The comment system is based on
&lt;a href=&quot;http://ivanzuzak.info/2011/02/18/github-hosted-comments-for-github-hosted-blogs.html&quot;&gt;comments on a GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt; and uses a small amount of Javascript to pull the comments across into the comment list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src='https://gist.github.com/6375681.js?file=post.html'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Acknowledgements:&lt;/h3&gt;

This release provides two improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The test output now includes an XML report with all the messages and an indication of test success or failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed the Test data directory settings from the web service because test packages are now always dropped in the App_Data directory&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>PG2 - Second day</title>
            <link href="http://pvandervelde.github.io/posts/2013-09-16_PG2-Second-day-flying.html"/>
            <updated>2013-09-16T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
            <id>http://pvandervelde.github.io/posts/2013-09-16_PG2-Second-day-flying.html</id>
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Sunday the weather was good enough for some flying on the west coast. So at 11.30am about 8 of us gathered at &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kariotahi_Beach&quot;&gt;Kario&lt;/a&gt; and the second day of my &lt;a href=&quot;/tags/PG2.html&quot;&gt;PG2&lt;/a&gt; had started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; alt=&quot;Paraglider soaring high over beautiful west coast&quot; src=&quot;/images/paragliding/paraglide_0004.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to notice about the west coast is that it looks amazing, rugged and empty. It seems that with paragliding besides the flying I also get to look out over the amazing landscapes New Zealand has. Double win!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before I get to fly as a qualified pilot a lot more training has to be had and that we did. The day started off with some ground handling exercises on the really old gliders. My first taste of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragliding#Reverse_launch&quot;&gt;reverse launching&lt;/a&gt; except with out the actual turning around and flying bit. It turns out reverse launching isn&amp;#39;t actually as simple as I thought it would be. Having flown kites for many years I thought I would get the reverse launch down pretty easily but when the gliders get larger and the controls are reversed things get difficult. More practise is required ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the ground handling a few short flights down the slope were made with a larger glider to practise the forward starts and then it was time to get some actual flights done. I managed to get three short flights in where I got to practise forward starts, turning and then landing. Some observations (which are probably obvious to those that have flown paragliders before): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is a distinct edge at the end of the start field then when you fly out over that edge the glider will climb rapidly due to the wind blasting straight up the edge. This is nothing to worry about, although it feels slightly disconcerting at first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A paraglider moves around more than you would think, even in a nice constant sea breeze&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you land at even a slight angle to the wind it gets really hard to put the glider on its back, instead of its side. I got only one landing totally right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Flying my new Gin Atlas&quot; src=&quot;/images/paragliding/paraglide_0005.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it was time for the unexpected highlight of the day. When I paid for the PG2 course I paid for a combination package, which includes the PG2 course, a glider and a harness. Now I still haven&amp;#39;t selected a harness but I have selected the glider, a bright red &lt;a href=&quot;http://gingliders.com/paragliders/atlas/&quot;&gt;Gin Atlas&lt;/a&gt;. I didn&amp;#39;t expect to be able to fly it so soon in my course but after my initial three flights both instructors gave me the go ahead to fly it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed a further two flights with it. The first one was a nice long soaring flight where I got to get a feel for the glider. At the end of the flight I managed to get quite a bit of height. And to top that flight off the instructor guided me in for a top landing upon which I nearly broke my glider by stuffing up the landing. Fortunately no gliders or pilots where hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last flight of the day was back down to the beach to pack our equipment and drive home. I set myself up for a landing approach and promptly overshot my selected landing spot by about 100 meters or so. I guess selecting and landing in the right spot is yet another skill I have to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all it was an amazing day of flying, especially the nice soaring flight on my shiny new glider.&lt;/p&gt;

This release provides several bug fixes for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The console application: Changed the way the REST URLs are constructed so that it works if the web service on a sub-part of a domain, e.g. &lt;code&gt;http://myserver/sherlock&lt;/code&gt; works now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The web service: Added Trace.Write statements for ease of debugging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The windows service: Fixed a dead-lock bug in the shut-down process and linked all processes via a Windows Job Object to ensure that all child processes are terminated if the service is terminated.&lt;/li&gt;

This release adds two new features and one improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new features are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to continue with a test sequence after a test step has failed. The test step should indicate that the failure mode is &amp;#39;continue&amp;#39;. Other option is &amp;#39;stop&amp;#39;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a test step that allows executing a console application with a set of input parameters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following gist gives an overview of what the configuration for the new console test step looks like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src='https://gist.github.com/6483292.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The improvement is in the HTML output report which is has been overhauled to improve the layout and readability.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>First time paragliding</title>
            <link href="http://pvandervelde.github.io/posts/2013-09-03_First-time-paragliding.html"/>
            <updated>2013-09-03T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
            <id>http://pvandervelde.github.io/posts/2013-09-03_First-time-paragliding.html</id>
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A little while ago I signed up for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://paraglidingnewzealand.com/information/learning-to-fly&quot;&gt;PG2&lt;/a&gt; paragliding course 
with &lt;a href=&quot;http://wingsandwaves.co.nz&quot;&gt;Wings and Waves&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately I signed up just before winter crept in and made it impossible to fly. As
we are moving towards spring the weather has been getting better and last Sunday the weather was good enough for us (my girlfriend and me) to
have our first shot at flying a paraglider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; alt=&quot;Casey ground handling the old glider&quot; src=&quot;/images/paragliding/paraglide_0001.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on Sunday morning we met up with the Wings and Waves crew and drove over to a nice, if some what soggy, hill somewhere around Pukemore, south of the Bombay hills for the first steps of our training. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part consisted of learning how to ground handle a paraglider. Ground handling is the art of controlling the paraglider while on the ground. This turns out to be harder than it first looks. In the air the pilot will normally be centred underneath the paraglider. On the ground however the pilot may not be directly below the paraglider which means the pilot needs to actively move around to keep the paraglider above them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Me doing a forward start with the old glider&quot; src=&quot;/images/paragliding/paraglide_0002.JPG&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we got the hang of the ground handling we started learning forwards starts, or alpine starts. With this method of starting you face forward with the glider behind you. Once you have sorted out the lines you move forwards until the lines are tensioned and then you run at a constant pace. The first glider we used was the really old one we used in ground handling. Given that it was not very large it was pretty easy to run with, and running we did, lots of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we got a few good runs in with the old glider the instructor found us a more modern paraglider to play with. This one was considerably larger and far more interesting. Over the remainder of the day we slowly worked our way up the hill, starting from a higher position each time, and being rewarded with a little more flight time and a little more height each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; alt=&quot;Casey having a little flight with the newer glider&quot; src=&quot;/images/paragliding/paraglide_0003.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning both my girl friend and me got to use the same glider but it turns out I&amp;#39;ve got a big fat ass and so I had to upgrade to bigger gliders a few more times. Each time being reminded that bigger gliders also mean more backwards pull on start and higher flights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all it was a good day flying. I still have a lot of work to do on all parts of my launching and flying skills (obviously given that this is the first time), but the one thing I really noticed I need to work on is distance estimation and flare timing. I got that wrong a few times and it was fortunate that the landing area was soggy because it made for nice, if what splashy, landings even if I miscalculated my flare timing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all a good time was had by all and we are definitely keen for more flying. Hopefully with less running and more flying next time.&lt;/p&gt;

            <id>http://pvandervelde.github.io/posts/2013-08-30_Why-this-blog-was-created.html</id>
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago I had a blog on Blogger but that never got further than a few posts, mainly because I ran out of interesting topics to write about. That
and my &lt;a href=&quot;/about.html&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; started interfering with life in general ... it seems research does that to ones life. In any case the old blog stalled and no
more posts were written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I have been wanting to improve my writing skills, you see, as software engineer I&amp;#39;m reasonably good at writing instructions for a three year
old, eh I mean a computer, but I am not particularly good at writing concise human-friendly text. I have written two dissertations, one for my master degree
and one for my PhD, but neither of those qualify as either concise or human-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the only way to get better at writing is to practise, practise and practise some more, I thought writing posts about things that interest me
would be a good way to improve my writing skills. And on top of that it may help me improve my skills in explaining technical constructs as well. Double win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing left to answer is what shall I be writing about. Well obviously those things that interest me, mostly being:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My open source &lt;a href=&quot;/projects.html&quot;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt;. All of them could do with some additional documentation and maybe even some examples. I guess having a 
blog is just an additional reason to finally write those&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the (exciting) things I get up to when rock climbing or paragliding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And if things progress nicely I might write some articles describing some work I am doing at the moment that is a continuation of the software
development I did for my PhD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
