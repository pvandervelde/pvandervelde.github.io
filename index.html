                <div id="post-content">
                    <p>One of the final chapters in the description of the development pipeline deals with security. In
this case I specifically mean the security of the pipeline and the underlying infrastructure,
not the security of the applications which are created using the pipeline.</p>
<p>The first question is why should you care about the security of the pipeline? After all
developers use the development pipelines via secured networks and their access permissions will be
set at the source control level. Additionally high trust levels exist between the pipeline
processes, the infrastructure and the source repository. In general this leads to the
security of the pipeline being placed lower on the priority list.</p>
<p>Which issues could you run into if you deem the security of the pipeline less critical? One
argument comes from
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332834111_Vulnerabilities_in_Continuous_Delivery_Pipelines_A_Case_Study">pen tests</a>
which show that CI/CD systems are a great way into
<a href="https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-15/materials/eu-15-Mittal-Continuous-Intrusion-Why-CI-Tools-Are-An-Attackers-Best-Friend.pdf">corporate networks</a>.
Additionally there have been a number of attacks aimed at
<a href="https://medium.com/&#64;hkparker/analysis-of-a-supply-chain-attack-2bd8fa8286ac">distributing</a> malicious
code through trusted software packages. These so called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_attack">supply chain attacks</a> try to compromise the user
by inserting malicious code in third-party dependencies, i.e. the source code supply chain.</p>
<p>In essence the problem comes down to the fact that the build pipeline and its associated infrastructure
have access to many different systems and resources which are normally not easily accessible for
its users. This makes your pipeline a target for malicious actors who could abuse some of the
following states for their own purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li>The development pipeline runs all tasks with the same user account on the executors and thereby
the same permissions. Obviously the worst case scenario would be running as an administrator.</li>
<li>Multiple pipeline invocations executed on a single machine, either in parallel or sequential,
which allows a task in a pipeline to access the workspace of another pipeline. This ability can
for instance be used to by-pass access controls on source code.</li>
<li>Downloading packages directly from external package repositories, e.g. NPM or Docker.</li>
<li>Direct access to the internet, which allows downloading of malicious code and uploading of artefacts
to undesired locations.</li>
<li>The development pipeline has the ability to update or overwrite existing artefacts.</li>
<li>The executors have direct access to different resources that normal pipeline users don't have
access to. Specifically if the same infrastructure is used to build artefacts and
to deploy them to the production environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the problems with securing the development pipeline is that all the actions mentioned above
are in one way or another required for the pipeline to function, after all the pipeline needs to be
able to build and distribute artefacts. The follow up question then becomes can you distinguish between
normal use and malicious use?</p>
<p>It turns out that distinguishing that this will be difficult because both forms of actions are
essentially the same, they both use the development pipeline for its intended purpose. So then in
order to prevent malicious use put up as many barriers to malicious use as possible, aka
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing)">defence in depth</a>. The following are a
number of possible ways to add barriers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grant the minimal possible permissions for the executors, both on the executor and from the executor
to the external resources. It is better to run the pipeline actions as a local user on the executor,
rather than using a domain user. Grant permissions to a specific resource to the action that
interacts with the resource.</li>
<li>Execute a single pipeline per executor and never reuse the executor.</li>
<li>Limit network connections to and from executors. In general executors do not need internet access,
save for a few pre-approved sites, .e.g. an artefact storage. There is also very little reason
for executors to connect to each other, especially if executors are short lived.</li>
<li>Pull packages, e.g. NPM or Docker, only from an internal feed. Additions to the internal feed are made
after the specific package has been reviewed.</li>
<li>The artefacts created with the pipeline should be tracked so that you know the origin, creation time,
storage locations and other data that can help identity an exact instance of an artefact. Under
ideal circumstances you would know exactly which sources and packages were used to create
the artefact as well.</li>
<li>Artefacts should be immutable and never be allowed to overwritten.</li>
<li>Do not use the executors that perform builds for deployments, use a set of executors that only
have deployment permissions but no permissions to source control etc..</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond these changes there are many other ways to reduce the attack surface as documented in the
security literature. In the end the goal of this post is more to point out that the security of the
development pipeline is important, rather than providing ways to make a pipeline more secure. The
exact solutions for pipeline security depend very heavily on the way the pipeline is constructed and
what other forms of security validation have been placed around the pipeline.</p>

                    <p>The <a href="/posts/Software-development-pipeline-considerations-for-infrastructure-improvements.html">last post</a>
I explained a few ways to improve the development pipeline infrastructure while
keeping downtime minimal. One important consideration for the
<a href="/posts/Software-development-pipeline-Design-resilience.html">resilience</a> of the
pipeline is to reduce the dependencies between the pipeline and the infrastructure.</p>
<p>So what does unwanted coupling between the pipeline and the
infrastructure mean? After all the pipeline code makes assumptions about the capabilities
of the infrastructure it runs on, just like every other piece of code.
For development pipelines examples of unwanted dependencies are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The pipeline is created by using tasks specific to a CI/CD system which means that the artefacts
can only be created on the infrastructure</li>
<li>Pipeline stages expect the outputs from previous stages to be available on the executor,
or worse, they expect the outputs from other pipelines to be on the executor</li>
<li>A pipeline task assumes that certain tools have been installed on the executors</li>
<li>A pipeline task assumes that it has specific permissions on an executor</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two items mentioned impacts the velocity at which development can take place. By relying
completely on the CI/CD system for artefact creation cycle times increases. Additionally
making changes to the pipeline often requires executing it multiple times to debug it.</p>
<p>The second set of items are related to the ease of switching tooling, e.g. when changing vendors
or during disaster recovery. These may or may not be of concern depending on the direction of
development and technology. In my experience vendor lock-in is something to keep in mind if for no
other reason then that switching vendors can be prohibitively complicated if pipeline processes are
too tightly coupled to the CI/CD system.</p>
<p>If any of the issues mentioned are concerning to you then partially or completely decoupling
the development pipeline from the infrastructure will be a worthwhile exercise. This
can be achieved with some of the following steps.</p>
<h4>Versions for everybody</h4>
<p>Ensure that all code, tools, scripts and resources used in the pipeline are versioned. That way you
know exactly what is required for a specific pipeline execution. Which make executions repeatable
in the future when newer versions of tools and resources have been released.</p>
<h4>Only the workspace is yours</h4>
<p>Pipeline actions should work only in their own workspace. Any code, scripts or tools they require
are put in the workspace. This reduces scattering of data during the execution of a pipeline and
reduces pollution of the executors.</p>
<h4>Lean executors</h4>
<p>Make your pipeline actions assume they will run on a bare minimum runtime. This will
ensure that your pipelines will obtain their preferred version of tools they need and
install them in their own workspace. The benefit of doing this that a pipeline can be executed on
any available executor, either in your CI/CD system or on a developer machine, as it will not be
making any assumptions about the capabilities of an executor.</p>
<h4>Single use executors are cleaner</h4>
<p>Configure the CI/CD system to use a clean executor for every job. This will ensure that changes made
during a previous job don't interfere with the current job. Additionally it will enforce the use of
immutable infrastructure for the executors, thus allowing versioning of the executors.</p>
<h4>Use the CI/CD system as a task executor</h4>
<p>Keep the configuration for the jobs in the CI/CD system to a minimum. Ideally the entire configuration
is the execution of a script or tools with a simple set of arguments. By reducing the job of the
CI/CD system to executing a script or tool it is simple to execute the pipeline actions somewhere
else, e.g. on a developer machine or a different CI/CD system.</p>
<h4>Treat pipeline services as critical</h4>
<p>All services used by the pipeline should be treated as mission critical systems. After all a failure
in one of these systems can stop all your pipelines from executing. So reduce the number of services
you use in your pipeline and improve the resilience the services you have to rely on using the standard
approaches.</p>

                </div>
                <div id="post-content">
                    <p>This post introduces the <a href="https://www.calvinverse.net/">Calvinverse</a>
<a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse">project</a> which provides the source code for the different resources
required to create the infrastructure for a build pipeline. The Calvinverse resources have been
developed for two main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide me with a way to experiment with and learn more about
<a href="https://thenewstack.io/a-brief-look-at-immutable-infrastructure-and-why-it-is-such-a-quest/">immutable</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jezhumble/status/970334897544900609">infrastructure</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code">infrastructure-as-code</a> as applied to build infrastructure.</li>
<li>To provide resources that can be used to set up the infrastructure for a complete
<a href="/posts/On-prem-vs-cloud-build-systems">on-prem</a> build system. The system should provide a build
controller with build agents, artefact storage and all the necessary tools to monitor the different
services and diagnose issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Calvinverse resources can be configured and deployed for different sizes of infrastructure, from
small setups only used by a few developers to a large setup used by many developers for the development
of many products. How to configure the resources for small, medium or large environments and their
hardware requirements will be discussed in future posts.</p>
<p>The resources in the Calvinverse project are designed to be run as a self-contained system. While
daily maintenance is minimal it is not a hosted system so some maintenance is required. For instance
OS updates will be required on a regular basis. These can either be applied to existing resources,
through the automatic updates, or by applying the new updates to the templates and then replacing
the existing resources with a new instance. The latter approach case can be automated, however there
is no code in any of the Calvinverse repositories to do this automatically.</p>
<p>The different resources in the Calvinverse project contain a set of tools and applications which
provide all the necessary capabilities to create the infrastructure for a build pipeline. Amongst these
capabilities are service discovery, build execution, artefact storage, metrics, alerting and
log processing.</p>
<p>The following applications and approaches are used for service discovery and configuration storage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using <a href="https://www.consul.io">Consul</a> to provide service discovery and machine discovery via
<a href="https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/dns.html">DNS</a> inside an environment. An environment is defined
as all machines that are part of a <a href="https://www.consul.io/docs/internals/architecture.html">consul datacenter</a>.
It is possible to have multiple environments where the machines may all be on the same network but
in general will not be communicating across environments. This is useful for cases where having
multiple environments makes sense, for instance when having a production environment and a test
environment. The benefit of using Consul as a DNS is that it allows a resource to have a consistent
name across different environments without the DNS names clashing. For instance if there is a
production environment and a test environment then it is possible to use the same DNS name
for a resource, even though the actual machine names will be different. This allows using the
Consul DNS name in tools and scripts without having to keep in mind the environment the tool
is deployed in.
Finally Consul is also used for the distributed key-value store that all applications can obtain
configuration information from thereby centralizing the configuration information.</li>
<li>Using one or more <a href="https://vaultproject.io">Vault</a> instance to handle all the secrets required
for the environment. Vault provides authenticated access for resources to securely access secrets,
login credentials and other information that should be kept secure. This allows centralizing the
storage and distribution of secrets</li>
</ul>
<p>For the build work Calvinverse uses the following applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jenkins.io">Jenkins</a> is used as the
<a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/resource.build.master">build controller</a>.</li>
<li>Build executors connect to Jenkins using the <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/swarm">swarm plugin</a> so
that agents can connect when it starts. In the Calvinverse project there are currently only
<a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/resource.build.agent.windows">Windows</a> based executors.</li>
</ul>
<p>For <a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/resource.artefacts">artefact storage</a> Calvin verse uses the
<a href="https://www.sonatype.com/nexus-repository-oss">Nexus</a> application. The image is configured such that
a new instance of the image will create artefact repositories for <a href="https://www.nuget.org">NuGet</a>,
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">Npm</a>, <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> and general ZIP artefacts.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/resource.queue">message distribution</a> Calvinverse uses the <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a> application. The image is configured such that a new instance of the image will
try to connect to the existing cluster in the environment. If no cluster exists then the first
instance of the image will form the start of the cluster in the environment.</p>
<p>Metrics, monitoring and alerting capabilities are provided by the
<a href="https://www.influxdata.com/">Influx</a> stack, consisting of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/">InfluxDB</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/resource.metrics.storage">metrics collection</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> for <a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/resource.metrics.dashboard">dashboards</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">Telegraf</a> is installed on each resource to collect metrics and send
them to InfluxDb.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/chronograf/">Chronograf</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/resource.metrics.monitoring">alert configurations</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/kapacitor/">Kapacitor</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/resource.metrics.monitoring">alerting</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Build and system logs are processed by the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elastic</a> stack consisting off:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/resource.documents.storage">log storage</a>, both system logs
and build logs</li>
<li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana">Kibana</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/resource.documents.dashboard">log dashboards</a>.</li>
<li>Logs collected via <a href="https://www.syslog-ng.com/products/open-source-log-management/">syslog-ng</a> on
Linux and a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/pvandervelde/filebeat.mqtt">Filebeat</a> on windows.
Logs are sent to RabbitMQ to ensure that the unprocessed logs aren't lost when something any part
of the log stack goes offline.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash">Logstash</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/resource.logs.processor">processing logs</a> from RabbitMQ to
Elasticsearch using <a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/calvinverse.logs.filters">filters</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It should be noted that while the Calvinverse resources combine to create a complete build environment
the resources might need some alterations to fit in with the work flow and processes that are being
followed. After all each company is different and applies different workflows. Additionally users
might want to replace some of the resources with versions of their own, e.g. to replace Influx with
<a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a>.</p>

    </div>
</div>

                </div>
                <div id="post-content">
                    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">Continuous integration (CI) systems</a> originally and
build pipelines recently have traditionally been available on-prem only with systems like <a href="https://jenkins.io">Jenkins</a>,
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/">TeamCity</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo">Bamboo</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Foundation_Server">TFS</a>. This is possibly due to the fact that these
systems needs relatively powerful hardware, mostly consisting of powerful CPU and fast IO, something
which was not easily available in the cloud until the last few years.</p>
<p>However in the last few years a number of cloud based CI systems have appeared e.g.
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/devops/">Azure DevOps</a>, <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/">AppVeyor</a>,
<a href="https://circleci.com/">CircleCi</a>), <a href="https://codeship.com/">CloudShip</a>,
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/">Google cloud build</a> and <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>. This
has lead to the question of where to locate a CI system? Should it be on-prem or in the cloud or potentially
even a combination of the two. This post should provide some suggestions on how to make the selection
between the different options.</p>
<h3>Cloud-based CI systems</h3>
<p>As with other cloud systems when using a cloud based CI system the user gets the benefits of not
having to worry about the underlying infrastructure and resources and having the ability to scale
the CI system to the size required, provided one pays for the additional resources.</p>
<p>The other side of the coin is that because the user has no influence on the infrastructure of the
CI system there is also no direct control over the hardware or the controller software. Thus the user
cannot increase the hardware specs for the controller or the agents and the user cannot determine
which plugins or capabilities are available in the CI system.
As a side effect this also means that the user does not have access to the logs, metrics and
file system for the underlying system, which provide information that may be useful when issues
arise. In general the controller specific logs and metrics are only useful if you have access to
the controller, however the build specific information is useful either for diagnostics
or future planning.</p>
<p>Besides the CI part of the system in some cases the entire pipeline will require other resources, e.g
artefact storage or test systems. Some cloud systems provide these additional systems as well, for a price
of course. Other systems require that these additional resources are provided in some other way.</p>
<h3>On-prem CI systems</h3>
<p>When running the CI system on-prem one has to both provide and maintain the infrastructure, hardware and networking etc.,
and the controller and executor software. This increases the overhead for running a CI system. Additionally
scaling the system either requires manual intervention or building the scaling capabilities.</p>
<p>On the other hand having control over the infrastructure means that the CI system can be configured
so that it fits the use case for the development teams, the desired plugins installed, executors with
all the right tools, full control over executor workspaces and with that the ability to lock down
sensitive information. Additionally logs and metrics can be collected from everywhere which
helps diagnostics, alerting and predictive capabilities on both the infrastructure side and the build
capacity side.</p>
<p>Finally having full control over the CI system means that it is possible to extend the system if
that is required with custom capabilities, either directly added to the CI system or as additional
services. It should of course be noted that this requires resources and is thus not free.</p>
<h3>Selecting a location for your CI system</h3>
<p>So how does one select a location for a CI system. Both cloud and on-prem have pros and cons and in the
end the location of the system depends very much on the situation of the development team. If the team works
for a company where there is no on-prem server infrastructure then a cloud based system will be the
only sensible approach. However there will also be cases where an on-prem system is the only sensible
option.</p>
<p>In order to decide for one system or the other the first thing that should be done is a cost
comparison, comparing the total cost of ownership, i.e. initial purchasing costs, running costs,
staff costs, training costs etc.. As part of the cost comparison the costs for additional parts
of the system should also be included, e.g. artefact storage or test systems. One should also note
that while cloud systems reduce maintenance, they are not maintenance free. The maintenance of the
infrastructure disappears but the maintenance of the builds and the workflow does not, after all no
matter where the build pipeline is located it is still important that it delivers the
<a href="/posts/Software-development-pipeline-Design-accuracy">accuracy</a>,
<a href="/posts/Software-development-pipeline-Design-performance.html">performance</a>,
<a href="/posts/Software-development-pipeline-Design-resilience.html">resilience</a> and
<a href="/posts/Software-development-pipeline-Design-flexibility.html">flexibility</a>.</p>
<p>Once the cost comparison is done there are other things to bring into the decision process. Because
while costs are important they are not the only reason to select one system or another. For instance
other comparison elements could be related to regulations that specify how source needs to be treated
or specific processes that should be followed, or the capabilities of the different CI systems for
example is the ability to execute builds on a specific OS. Not all cloud CI systems provide
executors for all the different OSes.</p>
<p>In the end the decision to select a cloud build system or a on-prem build system depends
very strongly on the situation the company is in. It is even possible that as time progresses
the best type of system may change from on-prem to cloud or visa versa. Both systems have their
own advantages and disadvantages. In the end all that matters is that a system that fits the
development process is selected, independent of what the different vendors say is the best thing.</p>

</div>

                </div>
                <div id="post-content">
                    <p>In one of the post from a <a href="/posts/Software-development-pipeline-Design-introduction.html">while ago</a> we
discussed what a software development pipeline is and what the <a href="/posts/Software-development-pipeline-Design-accuracy.html">most</a>
<a href="/posts/Software-development-pipeline-Design-performance.html">important</a>
<a href="/posts/Software-development-pipeline-Design-resilience.html">characteristics</a>
<a href="/posts/Software-development-pipeline-Design-flexibility.html">are</a>. Given that the pipeline is used
during the large majority of the development, test and release process it is fair to say that for
a software company the build and deployment pipeline infrastructure should be considered critical
infrastructure because without it the development team will be more limited in their ability to
perform their tasks. Note that at no stage should any specific tool, including the pipeline, be the
single point of failure. More on how to reduce the dependency on CI systems and the pipeline will
follow in another post.</p>
<p>Just like any other piece of infrastructure the development pipeline will need to be updated
and improved on a regular basis, either to fix bugs, patch security issues or to add new features
that will make the development team more productive. Because the pipeline falls in the critical
infrastructure category it is important to keep disturbances to a minimum while performing these
changes. There are two main parts to providing (nearly) continuous service while still providing
improvements and updates. The first is to ensure that the changes are tracked and tested properly,
the second is to deploy the exact changes that were tested to the production system in a way that no
or minimal interruptions occur. A sensible approach to the first part is to follow a solid software
development process so that the changes are controlled, verified and monitored which can be achieved
by creating infrastructure resources completely from information stored in source control, i.e. using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code">infrastructure-as-code</a>, making the resources
as <a href="https://thenewstack.io/a-brief-look-at-immutable-infrastructure-and-why-it-is-such-a-quest/">immutable</a>
as <a href="https://twitter.com/jezhumble/status/970334897544900609">possible</a> and performing automated tests
on these resources after deploying them in a test environment using the same deployment process that
will be used to deploy the resources to the production environment.</p>
<p>Using this approach should allow the creation of resources that are thoroughly tested and can be
deployed in a sensible fashion. It should be noted that no amount of automated testing will
guarantee that the new resources are free of any issues so it will always be important use deployment
techniques that allow for example <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html">quick roll-back</a>
or <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html">staged roll-outs</a>. Additionally deployed
resources should be carefully monitored so that issues will be discovered quickly.</p>
<p>To achieve the goal of being able to deploy updates and improvements to the development
infrastructure the following steps can be taken</p>
<ul>
<li>Using infrastructure-as-code to create new resource images each time a resource needs to be updated.
Trying to create resources by hand will drastically reduce the ease at which they can be build and
be made consistently. Resources that are deployed into an environment should never be changed. If
bugs need to be fixed or new features need to be added then a new version of the resource image
should be created, tested and deployed. That way changes can be tested before deployment and
the configuration of the deployed resources will be known.</li>
<li>Resources should be placed on virtual machines or in (Docker) containers. Both technologies provide
an easy way to create one or more instances of the resource which is required in order to test or
scale a service. The general idea is to have one resource per VM / container instance. One resource
may contain multiple services or daemons but it always serves a single goal. Note that in some cases
people will state that you should only use containers and not VMs but there are still cases where
a VM works better, e.g. in some cases executing software builds works better in a VM or running
a service that stores large quantities of data. Additionally if all or a large part of the
infrastructure is running on VMs then using VMs might make more sense. In all cases the correct
approach, container or VMs, is the one that makes sense for the environment the resources will
be deployed into.</li>
<li>Some way of getting configurations into the resource. Some configurations can be hard-coded into
the resource, if they are never expected to be changed. The draw-back of encoding a configuration
into a resource is that this configuration cannot be changed if the resource is used in different
environments, e.g. a test environment and a production environment. Configurations which are
different between environments should not be encoded in the resource since that may prevent the
resource from being deployed in a test environment for testing. Provisioning a resource requires
that you can apply all the environment specific information to a resource which is a difficult
problem to solve especially for the initial set of configurations, e.g. the configurations which
determine where to get the remaining configurations. Several options are:
<ul>
<li>For VMs you can use DVD / ISO files that are linked on first start-up of the resource.</li>
<li>Systems like <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template">consul-template</a> can generate
configurations from a distributed key-value store.</li>
<li>Resources can be pull their own configurations from a shared store.</li>
<li>For containers often environment variables are used. These might be sufficient but note that they
are not secure, both inside the container and outside the container.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Configurations that should be provided when a resource is provisioned should be stored
in source control, just like the resource code is, in order to be able to automate the verification
and delivery of the configuration values.
<ul>
<li>The infrastructure should have it's own shared storage for configurations so that the &lsquo;build&rsquo;
process can push to the shared storage and configurations are distributed from there. That ensures
that the build process doesn't need to know where to deliver exactly (which can change as the
infrastructure changes). One option is to use SQL / no-SQL type storage (e.g. Elasticsearch),
another option is to use a system like <a href="https://consul.io">consul</a> which has a distributed key-value
store</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Automatic testing of a resource once it is deployed into an environment. For the very least the
smoke tests should be run automatically when the resource is deployed to a test environment.</li>
<li>Automatic deployments when a new resource becomes available or approved for an environment, for
the very least to the test environment but ideally to all environments. Using the same deployment
system for all environments is highly recommended because this allows testing the deployment
process as well as the resource.</li>
</ul>
<p>A general workflow for the creation of a new resource or to update a resource could be</p>
<ul>
<li>Update the code for the resource. This code can consist of Docker files, <a href="https://www.chef.io/">Chef</a>
or <a href="https://puppet.com/">Puppet</a>, scripts etc.. The most important thing is that the files are
stored in source control and a sensible source control strategy is used.</li>
<li>Once the changes are made a new resource can be created from the code.
<ul>
<li>It is sensible to validate the sources using one or more suitable linters. Especially for infrastructure
resources it is sensible to validate the sources before trying to create the resource because it
potentially takes a long time to build a resource. Any errors that can be found sooner in the
process will reduce the cycle time.</li>
<li>Execute unit tests, e.g. <a href="https://docs.chef.io/chefspec.html">ChefSpec</a>, against the sources.
Again, building a resource can take a long time so validation before trying to create the resource
will reduce the cycle time.</li>
<li>Actually create the new resource. For Docker containers this can be done from a
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/">docker file</a>. For a VM this can be done with
<a href="https://packer.io">Packer</a>. Building a VM will take longer than building a docker container in
most cases. Note that building resources will in general take longer than building applications
it is sensible to use the build / deployment pipeline to build the resources that make up the
build / deployment pipeline. By using the pipeline it is possible to create the artefacts for
the services and then use these artefacts to create the resource.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deploy the resource to a (small) test environment and execute the tests against the newly created
resource.</li>
<li>Once the tests have passed the newly made image can be &lsquo;promoted&rsquo;, i.e. approved for use in the
production environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the approaches mentioned above it is possible to improve the development pipeline without
causing unnecessary disturbances for the development team.</p>
