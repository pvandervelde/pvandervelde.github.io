                    <p>While testing the <a href="posts/Robotics-a-bumper-for-scuttle-electronics">bumper</a> for SCUTTLE I noticed
that when reversing SCUTTLE would start a turn instead of driving straight backwards due to one
motor turning faster than the other motor. There are a number of reasons this could be happening,
for instance the driver code isn't properly commanding the motors, or the encoders are returning
incorrect data, etc..</p>
<figure style="float:left">
<img alt="Encoder output for failing encode" src="/assets/images/robotics/scuttle/scuttle-encoder-fail.png" />
<figcaption>Encoder output for failing encoder</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The first thing I did for my investigation was to make sure my encoders provide sensible data. The
non-ROS SCUTTLE code contains a useful <a href="https://github.com/scuttlerobot/SCUTTLE/blob/ce82a52ad025408a15f23f19c58add1321253783/software/python/basics/L1_encoder.py">Python script</a>
to measure the current value of the wheel encoders in a loop. I ran this code for a few minutes
while the wheels were stationary. In theory the results of this measurement should be two consistent
values, one for the left encoder and one for the right encoder. As you can see in the graph
it turns out that the angle measurement provided by the left encoder was very noisy.</p>
<p>While a noisy encoder shouldn't by itself cause the incorrect reversing pattern, it will make it more
difficult to find the actual cause of the problem. So before I address the bumper reversing behaviour
I needed to fix the encoder noise. The two main reasons for noisy encoder data that I could think of
were:</p>
<ul>
<li>The encoder is broken in some way. SCUTTLE uses the
<a href="https://nz.mouser.com/ProductDetail/ams-OSRAM/AS5048B-TS_EK_AB?qs=Rt6VE0PE%2FOduJIB%252BRfeBZQ%3D%3D">AS5048A position sensor</a>
which is relatively robust, but can be broken if you send the I2c commands on the wrong pins. Which
could happen if you say ... put the connector on the wrong way when assembling your SCUTTLE ...</li>
<li>The distance between the encoder and the magnet on the motor shaft isn't correct. The specifications
for the encoder state that the distance between the chip and the magnet on the motor shaft should
be between 0.5mm and 2.5mm, assuming a magnet of the recommended size and strength is used.</li>
</ul>
<p>I tried measuring the distance between the encoder and the magnet, but that isn't easy. There is no way
to get a measuring tool near that space so I had to resort to indirect measurements. I measured the
left and right brackets. They were about 0.5mm difference in size. That doesn't seem much but it
would be enough to push the encoder out too far from the magnet.</p>
<p>One solution would be to slightly sand the taller bracket so that both brackets are the size height.
In doing that I would have to be very careful to ensure that I sand the bracket flat, i.e. with
no change in angle in the face. A second solution is to remove the encoders from their brackets and
swap the brackets over.</p>
<figure style="float:right">
<img alt="Encoder output for functioning encoders" src="/assets/images/robotics/scuttle/scuttle-encoder-fixed.png" />
<figcaption>Encoder output for functioning encoders</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As the latter is relatively easy to do that is the first solution I tried. I took the encoders
of their brackets and attached them to the other bracket. These brackets were put back on SCUTTLE and
the test script was executed once again. And this time both encoders gave me consistent results. I was
expecting the other encoder to go bad due to distance, but apparently both encoders are with in the
distance specification with this new configuration.</p>
<p>With the encoder issue fixed I can get back to diagnosing the issue with the bumper reverse action.
My current suspicion is that the issue is caused by the fact that the the current SCUTTLE driver
code is written as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-loop_controller">open loop</a>. This means
that there is no feedback to the motor control software that indicates how fast the wheels are
actually turning in response to a given motor input. And because even motors of the same type
are all slightly different, they all react differently to the same motor input. In my case at
low speeds one of my motors responds earlier than the other motor. In the end this means that
at low speeds the bumper code thinks scuttle is driving backwards in a straight line while it
is actually driving around in circles.</p>

                <div id="post-content">
                    <p>The final part of building a bumper for SCUTTLE is to assemble the electronics component which translates
the movement of the bumper into signals which can be processed by the bumper software. In order to do
this I designed a simple circuit using <a href="https://www.kicad.org/">KiCad</a> and advice from one of the
many robotics forums.</p>
<figure style="float:left">
<img alt="SCUTTLE bumper electronics schematic" src="/assets/images/robotics/scuttle/scuttle-bumper-kicad.png" />
<figcaption>SCUTTLE bumper electronics schematic made in KiCad</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The circuit contains a microswitch as the trigger. The switch is connected to one of the 3.3V output
pins on the raspberry PI 4 board on one side and to one of the GPIO pins on the other side. When
the switch is depressed the circuit closes and the GPIO pin is driven to 3.3V, which is considered
a high signal. In order to ensure that the voltage on the GPIO pin is 0V when the circuit is not
closed I added a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-up_resistor">pull down</a> resistor. On the
raspberry PI it is possible to programmatically add a pull down resistor, however because I'm
using this as a learning exercise I thought it would be more suitable to include a physical pull down
resistor in the circuit.</p>
<p>The next thing I wanted from the circuit was the ability to see if the circuit was closed or not, so
that when I'm debugging it is obvious if there is a problem with the power, electronics or software.
For this purpose I added a yellow LED to the circuit, which lights up when the circuit is closed.
Adding the LED then adds the requirement to protect it from over current in case that the input pin
was programmed to be an output pin by mistake. For this purpose I added a resistor next to the input
pin.</p>
<figure style="float:right">
<img alt="SCUTTLE bumper electronics boards" src="/assets/images/robotics/scuttle/scuttle-bumper-electronics-boards.jpg" />
<figcaption>SCUTTLE bumper electronics boards</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After testing the circuit on the breadboard the next step was to solder two switch boards and
a distribution board. Each switch board would have a micro-switch, the LED, the resistors and a
JST-XH three pin connector for power, ground and signal wires.
The distribution board would have four JST-XH three pin connectors and one JST-XH six pin connector.
The four three pin connectors would allow me to have a front bumper and a rear bumper, each
having a switch board on the left and the right. I used JST-XH connectors instead of the Dupont
connectors because the JST connectors are directional, thereby removing any potential issues with
plugging the connector in the wrong way.</p>
<p>Part of this journey involved learning how to solder electronics components. I bought a Weller WE 1010
soldering station for this and future jobs. I managed to do a reasonable job soldering the parts but
it is obvious that I still have a lot to learn when it comes to soldering.</p>

</figure>
<p>The last task was to crimp the connectors and connect the boards. Because the raspberry Pi has a
Dupont header I needed to crimp both Dupont connectors and JST-XH connectors. For the Dupont connectors
I got an Iwiss SN-025 crimper. It works pretty well for those connectors. However the crimper dies are
too wide for the JST-XH connectors. So to crimp the JST-XH connectors I had to get a different
crimper with narrower dies. So for this I got an Engineer PAD-11 crimper. While this is not a
ratcheting crimper it works really well, at least for the JST-XH connectors.</p>
<p>So now that the mechanical setup is done, the software is, mostly, done and the electronics have
been soldered and connected my bumper works. Sort of. It turns out that there is a
problems with my SCUTTLE that make the bump response only work partially. It seems that
there is an issue with the wheel encoders, which causes the software to not know how much one of the
wheels has rotated. I will discuss fixing the encoders in another post.</p>

                <div id="post-content">
                    <p>In my <a href="posts/Robotics-a-bumper-for-scuttle-overview">previous post</a> I talked about creating a bump
sensor for my SCUTTLE robot. After creating the mechanical design I started working on the software.
There are two parts to the software, translating the state of the micro switches and turning the state
changes into movement commands for the robot, i.e. if the robot runs into
an obstacle it should stop and reverse its last movement. I decided to create a
<a href="https://www.ros.org/">ROS</a> node for each of these actions, i.e. one node
for the movement generation and one to translate the switch states. The reason for
creating two nodes instead of putting all the code into one node is that this allows me to run the
movement generation code both in a simulation and on the physical robot. So I gain the ability to
test more of my code, but I lose a bit of performance because the two nodes communicate using
messages which is slower than just using method calls.</p>
<p>To test the bump sensor code I use <a href="https://gazebosim.org/home">Gazebo</a> to simulate how the bump
sensor would work. Gazebo has the ability to calculate collisions
and create <a href="http://docs.ros.org/en/api/gazebo_msgs/html/msg/ContactsState.html">ContactsState</a>
messages based on these collision calculations. So I created a third ROS node to translate these
Gazebo messages to my own <a href="https://github.com/pvandervelde/scuttle_ros_msgs/blob/noetic/msg/BumperEvent.msg">bumper event messages</a>.
With that I can test my obstacle response code in Gazebo which provides a more controlled environment
than the physical robot does.</p>
<p>The first thing to do is to update the robot definition to include the bumper. This is done by adding
the <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/XML/link">links</a> and <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/XML/joint">joints</a> that
make up my bumper to an <a href="https://github.com/pvandervelde/scuttle_bumper/blob/master/urdf/bumper.xacro">URDF file</a>.
This URDF file is linked to the main <a href="https://github.com/scuttlerobot/scuttle_description">model description</a>
for SCUTTLE. After that I added the information for the <a href="https://classic.gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_gzplugins#Bumper">Gazebo bumper sensor</a>.
In the URDF file this looks as follows:</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;gazebo reference=&quot;front_bumper_plate_left_link&quot;&gt;
        &lt;sensor name=&quot;front_bumper_left&quot; type=&quot;contact&quot;&gt;
            &lt;selfCollide&gt;true&lt;/selfCollide&gt;
            &lt;alwaysOn&gt;true&lt;/alwaysOn&gt;
            &lt;updateRate&gt;15.0&lt;/updateRate&gt;
            &lt;material&gt;Gazebo/WhiteGlow&lt;/material&gt;
            &lt;contact&gt;
                &lt;collision&gt;base_link_fixed_joint_lump__front_bumper_plate_left_cl_collision_3&lt;/collision&gt;
                &lt;topic&gt;bumper_contact&lt;/topic&gt;
            &lt;/contact&gt;
            &lt;plugin name=&quot;gazebo_ros_bumper_controller_front_left&quot; filename=&quot;libgazebo_ros_bumper.so&quot;&gt;
                &lt;bumperTopicName&gt;scuttle_bumper&lt;/bumperTopicName&gt;
                &lt;frameName&gt;front_bumper_plate_left_link&lt;/frameName&gt;
            &lt;/plugin&gt;
        &lt;/sensor&gt;
    &lt;/gazebo&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I found that defining a contact sensor for Gazebo requires getting the link ID correct. In order to
do so you need to follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bumper contact information needs to be defined inside a <a href="https://classic.gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_urdf&amp;cat=connect_ros"><code>gazebo</code></a>
element. This <code>gazebo</code> element should have a <code>reference</code> attribute that points to the link that is
to be used as the bumper surface.</li>
<li>The name for the <code>collision</code> element needs to be found after translation to the SDF format. Normally
this is something Gazebo does internally. In this case you'll need to do this manually. If your
geometry is defined in an <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/xacro">xacro</a> file then you first need to translate
this to URDF using the <code>rosrun xacro xacro --inorder -o model.urdf model.urdf.xacro</code> command. After
that you can translate the URDF to SDF with the <code>gz sdf -p scuttle.urdf &gt; scuttle.sdf</code> command. Once
you have the SDF file you can search for the
<a href="https://answers.gazebosim.org/question/21992/what-collision-name-is-supposed-to-be-passed-to-contact-sensor/">correct element IDs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the above example the collision name, <code>base_link_fixed_joint_lump__front_bumper_plate_left_cl_collision_3</code>,
is the one you need to extract from the SDF file. Note that it can change if you make changes to
your xacro / URDF file, so in that case you will need to extract it again.</p>
<p>Once you have defined the URDF Gazebo will generate contact messages when the bumper hits an object.
These contact messages contain information describing where the contact occurred on the geometry mesh,
so in theory I could have used this information to determine if the contact would trigger the left
limit switch or the right limit switch or both. However that requires a decent amount of calculations
which is both work and introduces the potential for errors. So I opted to split the bumper into
two parts, one for the left side and one for the right side. If anything contacts anywhere on the
left side I consider that a trigger for the left part of the bumper and similar for the right side.</p>
<figure style="float:left">
<img alt="SCUTTLE with bumper in RViz" src="/assets/images/robotics/scuttle/scuttle-with-bumper-in-rviz.png" />
<figcaption>SCUTTLE with bumper in RViz</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>With the URDF work done I started writing the code for the different ROS nodes. First
the <a href="https://github.com/pvandervelde/scuttle_bumper/blob/master/src/gazebo_contact_sensor_translator.py">gazebo translator node</a>.
This node subscribes to the <a href="http://docs.ros.org/en/api/gazebo_msgs/html/msg/ContactsState.html">ContactsState</a>
messages that Gazebo sends when the bumper geometry collides with something. These messages are then
translated to a <a href="https://github.com/pvandervelde/scuttle_ros_msgs/blob/noetic/msg/BumperEvent.msg">BumperEvent</a>
message for further processing.</p>
<p>One interesting observation about the Gazebo contact messages are that they exhibit something
similar to <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/index.php/encyclopedia/term/switch-bounce">switch bounce</a>, in other
words it seems that the contact is intermittent even if the bumper plate is in solid contact with
the object. I'm guessing that this is caused by the fact that calculating collisions between moving
surfaces is difficult. In the end it doesn't matter what causes this behaviour though because we
need to <a href="https://github.com/pvandervelde/scuttle_bumper/blob/master/src/debounce.py">deal with it</a> in
some sensible way.</p>
<p>Once the bumper event messages have been generated they are processed by the
<a href="https://github.com/pvandervelde/scuttle_bumper/blob/master/src/bumper_navigator.py">second node</a>.
This node subscribes to both odometry events and bumper events. Internally it keeps track of the
motion state of SCUTTLE. On reception of a bumper event the node sends a
<a href="http://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Twist.html">velocity command</a>
to stop the robot. Once the robot has stopped it sends commands for it to reverse course far enough
that it is no longer contact with the obstacle.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that while the bumper code is working to reverse course after hitting an obstacle,
the other parts of ROS, e.g. the navigation stack, are probably still trying to steer the robot in the
original direction because those parts don't know about the obstacle. After all it is not on the
navigation map. This results in many different velocity commands being send, which could be very
confusing for the robot. One design decision was to make the bumper code unaware of other nodes. This
was done because allowing the bumper code to supress velocity
commands from other nodes would imply that the bumper code is always the most important publisher
when it comes to velocity commands. There are cases where this isn't true, e.g. when using
the bumpers to park SCUTTLE against a specific object like in the case of a docking station.</p>
<p>To ensure that a consistent set of velocity commands are sent to the motors I used the
<a href="http://wiki.ros.org/twist_mux">twist multiplexer node</a> which takes in velocity commands from
many nodes and forwards them using a priority-based scheme. In the current implementation the
priorities are, from low to high</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigation</li>
<li>Keyboard</li>
<li>Bumper</li>
<li>Joypad / Joystick</li>
</ul>

    allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p>By using the twist multiplexer mode it is easy for users to change the priority by changing a configuration
file instead of having to change the bumper code.</p>
<p>With that the bumper code is able to make SCUTTLE respond to objects it bumps into. The next step in
the process of adding bump sensors to SCUTTLE is to assemble the electronic components so that the
movement of the bumper can be registered and reported to the software components.</p>
<p>Finally a addition to the software that needs to be made is the ability to add the obstacles in the
navigation map so that SCUTTLE can navigate around the newly discovered obstacles.</p>

                    <p>In order to allow my SCUTTLE robot to drive around autonomously it needs some sensors so that it
can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping">perceive its surroundings</a>.
One of the ways in which this is normally achieved is by adding a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar">LIDAR</a>
unit. Unfortunately I don't have one of those, and LIDAR units are relatively expensive in New Zealand.
Additionally I figured I'd learn more about robot sensors if I set up some simple sensors for my
SCUTTLE robot before getting a LIDAR.</p>
<figure style="float:left">
<img alt="CAD model of the SCUTTLE bumper" src="/assets/images/robotics/scuttle/scuttle-bumper-cad-model.png" />
<figcaption>The CAD model of the SCUTTLE bumper</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So I decided to start with the simplest kind of sensor, the bump sensor. This type of sensor
consists of one or more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_switch">limit switches</a> and a bumper
surface, i.e. some kind of plate that bumps into things. This plate is held in place by springs thereby
giving it the ability to move while also returning to its original position.
When the robot bumps into an object with the plate, the springs are compressed and the plate hits
the limit switches. These switches then signal the robot that it has hit something. At that point the
robot can stop its motion and back away from the obstacle. As the robot backs away the springs push the
bumper plate away from the limit switches. The change in switch state then signals to the robot that
it is no longer in contact with the obstacle and can thus continue on its journey.</p>
<p>Overall this doesn't sound very complicated so it should be pretty quick and easy to build the
bump sensor ...</p>
<p>Several weeks down the line I nearly finished my bump sensors</p>
<p>The first part of my build was the design of the physical parts that I need to attach to SCUTTLE. I
build the bumper with simple parts because I don't have access to a workshop or a 3D printer. So
the bumper is a UHMWPE plate reinforced by some 90 degree aluminium extrusions. This prevents the
plate from flexing when it contacts an obstacle. The plate is attached to two angle brackets, one on
the left side and one on the right side. It is attached using four M3 bolts wrapped with springs,
2 bolts for each side. The idea behind using 2 bolts per side is that this should provide some
rotational stability while keeping the construction simple. Finally the angle brackets is attached
to the scuttle frame with two T slot nuts.</p>
<p>I found that the springs that keep the plate in the extended position have to be quite soft, otherwise
SCUTTLE won't be able to compress the springs when it hits something at low speed. The first
set of springs I got from Amazon were too stiff. For the second set of springs I got some ballpoint
pen springs of Aliexpress which are much less stiff.</p>
<figure style="float:right">
<img alt="SCUTTLE with its new bumper" src="/assets/images/robotics/scuttle/scuttle-with-bumper.jpg" />
<figcaption>SCUTTLE with its new bumper</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This first version of the bumper mechanics works relatively well but for the next version there
are some things I want to change</p>
<ul>
<li>The bolts have full thread on them which sometimes causes the bolts to get hung up on the tread. I
had some issues finding partially threaded bolts with the right length and diameter.</li>
<li>The current design allows left to right tilt which is good, but also top to bottom tilt. The latter
is not so good as it potentially allows SCUTTLE to hit an obstacle without noticing. A better design
would allow left to right rotation of the bumper but little to no top to bottom rotation. This
allows the left and right limit switches to be triggered individually when SCUTTLE hits an obstacle
on the left or right side respectively while ensuring that the limit switches are always triggered
if the bumper hits something, even if the obstacle is low to the ground.</li>
<li>The current bumper shape is a flat plate, it would be better if the bumper plate was curved. If the
curved bumper is given the right radius it would allow SCUTTLE to rotate in place after hitting
an obstacle without getting stuck. Obviously creating a curved bumper will increase construction
effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>The mechanical design of the bumper is only one part of the task. In order for SCUTTLE to be able
to respond to hitting an object I need to have have software that can respond to signals from the
limit switches and the appropriate electronics that transfers the limit switch state to the
raspberry pi. The electronics and the software that I created for this bumper will be described in
separate posts.</p>

                    <p>After getting familiar with <a href="posts/Robotics-learning-ros">ROS</a>, the next step was to get the
navigation stack working in Gazebo for the SCUTTLE robot. Fortunately, the SCUTTLE developers
had already created a number of ROS packages containing the
<a href="https://github.com/scuttlerobot/scuttle_description">scuttle model</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/scuttlerobot/scuttle_bringup">the startup scripts</a> and the
<a href="https://github.com/scuttlerobot/scuttle_driver">driver code</a>. All the bits you need to drive SCUTTLE
around using ROS.</p>
<p>The first challenge is to drive the SCUTTLE model around in <a href="https://gazebosim.org/">Gazebo</a>
using the <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/teleop_twist_keyboard">keyboard</a>.
This was easily achieved using Gazebo and RViz using WSL2, but it was a bit slow.</p>

    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture">
</iframe>
<p>The next challenge was to make the virtual SCUTTLE drive to a specific point using a custom
ROS node. While doing the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/ros-essentials/">ROS for beginners I</a> course
I wrote some code to do a move-to-goal for the <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/turtlesim">turtlesim</a> virtual
robot. The <a href="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/35200cce52d416d899c3db600c98a4a5">code</a> was updated
and then used for the SCUTTLE robot. The result is a robot that moves to a goal, mission accomplished!</p>
<p>The final challenge, for now at least, is to get the navigation stack to work for SCUTTLE. In order
to do so a few new packages needed to be created. The packages I created are</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/scuttlerobot/scuttle_slam">scuttle_slam</a> - Contains the configurations and
launch files for running <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping">gmapping</a> SLAM using the SCUTTLE LIDAR.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/scuttlerobot/scuttle_navigation">scuttle_navigation</a> - Contains the
configuration for working with the <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/navigation">navigation stack</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/scuttlerobot/scuttle_gazebo">scuttle_gazebo</a> - Contains a number of Gazebo
worlds for testing our virtual SCUTTLE.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>scuttle_slam</code> and <code>scuttle_navigation</code> packages are based on the similar packages for
<a href="https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3">turtlebot3</a> with adjustments so that the configuration
matches SCUTTLE's performance.</p>
<p>For navigation in ROS1, you need two different types of path planners and a map for each planner. The
first type is the global planner, which uses a map to determine the fastest path from the current
location to the goal location. The second type, called the local planner, navigates the robot to
the goal by trying to follow the path created by the global planner. The path followed by the local
planner may deviate from the global path due to previously unknown obstacles and limitations of the
robot, e.g. the ability to follow a turn. The map for each planner is known as a <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/costmap_2d">costmap</a>
which indicates which part of the surroundings are occupied by obstacles and which parts can be
navigated. After configuring the planners and the costmaps, the navigation worked. I could use
RViz to set a point on the map and the virtual SCUTTLE would navigate to that location automatically.
Success!</p>

<figcaption>SCUTTLE robot navigating a room in RViz</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now, not everything was fine. The <a href="https://answers.ros.org/question/397737/dwa-local-planner-cant-find-a-trajectory-unless-rotate-recovery-runs">first issue</a>
is some weird behaviour with the <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/dwa_local_planner?distro=noetic">DWA local planner</a>.
Once the robot is moving the local planner mostly does a good job. However, when starting a path it
takes a while for the local planner to pick up the global path. In fact, the DWA planner doesn't seem
to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt9XyJHzfas&amp;ab_channel=PatrickvanderVelde">accept the global plan</a>
until after a <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/rotate_recovery?distro=noetic">rotate recovery</a> has taken place.
So far, I haven't found a solution to this problem.</p>
<p>The second issue is that, in some cases, the navigation stack fails to find a path out of a narrow
hallway or though a narrow door. In general, this happens when exploring a location, e.g. using the
<a href="http://wiki.ros.org/explore_lite">explore_lite</a> package. It seems that the algorithm
can't find a turn that will rotate the robot in the available space, even though scuttle is
able to perform in-place rotations. At the start of a navigation exercise, in-place rotations are
gladly used. However once the robot is on the move, the algorithm doesn't seem to apply in-place
rotations anymore.</p>
<p>Finally, you have to keep in mind that the default planners for ROS are path planners. This means that
they plan a path from the start to the destination. These paths, however, only describe the direction
a robot should take at a given location. They don't describe velocity or acceleration. Only
describing the direction can generate paths with abrupt turns that force the robot to slow
down significantly. Using a trajectory planner, which at least prescribes velocities, makes for a
smoother experience for robot and cargo.</p>
