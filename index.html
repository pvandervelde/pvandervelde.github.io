<a href="https://github.com/ops-resource/ops-tools-build">Ops-Tools-Build</a> toolkit was released.</p>
<p>This release was focussed on providing the capabilities to use the Chef toolset to create new
resources. All the work items that have been closed for this release can be found on
<a href="https://github.com/ops-resource/ops-tools-build/milestone/2?closed=1">github</a>.</p>
<h3>New functionality</h3>

of <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild">nBuildKit</a> has been released. This release fixes
a number of bugs and adds a few new improvements</p>
<p>All the work items that have been closed for this release can be found on
<a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/milestone/31?closed=1">github</a>.</p>
<h3>Bugs fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/280">280</a> - The <code>deploy.pushto.gitbranch</code>
script called the <code>GitCurrentBranch</code> task with a <code>WorkingDirectory</code> property which did not exist,
thus causing the pushing to a git branch deployment step to fail.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/281">281</a> - The <code>deploy.pushto.gitbranch</code>
script did not create the directory into which the repository should be cloned. This caused the
step to fail.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/286">286</a> - The <code>GenerateTargetsFile</code> custom
task applied a custom assembly resolver which did not resolve references to the MsBuild assemblies.
This is a problem for MsBuild 15.0 and higher because from that version onwards the MsBuild assemblies,
e.g. <code>Microsoft.Build.XX</code> are no longer located in the GAC and can thus not be found by the standard
assembly resolver.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/287">287</a> - The <code>shared.prepare.copy.files</code>
task did not correctly copy the directory hierarchy.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/290">290</a> - The <code>build.prepare.generatefiles</code>
script only generated the files if they did not exist. This has been changed so that generated
files are always created and updated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/254">254</a> - All warnings and errors have been
given a proper error code for easier parsing of errors from the log.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/282">282</a> - The Git, Powershell and NuGet
base tasks have been moved to the Core targets assembly so that they can be used in third party
custom tasks as well.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/284">284</a> - A new task has been added that
allows extracting files from one or more ZIP archive files.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/285">285</a> - Additional conditions have been
added to all <code>ItemGroup</code> elements to ensure that these item groups are only loaded when they are
required. This reduces build times and improves stability.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/288">288</a> - A new task has been added that
allows downloading files from a HTTP URL. If the file in question is an archive file it can
additionally be unzipped before the final copy takes place.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally the first steps to better documentation have been taken. The <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/blob/master/README.md">readme</a>,
the <a href="http://nbuildkit.github.io/nBuildKit.MsBuild/">introduction</a> and the <a href="http://nbuildkit.github.io/nBuildKit.MsBuild/docs/contributing">contributing</a>
documents have been updated.</p>

                    <p>Hot on the heels of the last release version <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/releases/tag/0.9.1">0.9.1</a>
of <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild">nBuildKit</a> has been released. This release fixes
two bugs and adds a few internal improvements.</p>
<p>All the work items that have been closed for this release can be found on
<a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/milestone/29?closed=1">github</a>.</p>
<h3>Bugs fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/273">273</a> - The <code>CalculateSemanticVersionWithGitVersion</code>
task used the current directory as the working directory. While that is correct in most cases
there are some cases, especially when running the integration tests, where that is not correct.
This has been fixed by requiring the specification of the working directory.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/277">277</a> - In the same way all NuGet tasks
now need a working directory specified in order to make sure that the correct workspace is used
when interacting with the NuGet command line.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/272">272</a> - The
<a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/blob/master/src/tests/TestFunctions.PrepareWorkspace.ps1">TestFunctions.PrepareWorkspace.ps1</a>
and the <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/blob/master/src/tests/TestFunctions.Git.ps1">TestFunctions.Git.ps1</a>
have been updated with additional functions and checks so that when creating a test workspace the
existing git flow process is only completed if the specified branch exists on the remote. This changes
the completion of the git flow process from mandatory to optional.</li>
<li>Additionally the <code>IsMasterBranch</code> and <code>IsDevelopBranch</code> properties have been defined in the settings
file. These two properties indicate whether or not the current branch is the <code>master</code> or <code>develop</code>
branch respectively.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/69">69</a> - The documentation for nBuildKit itself
is being moved from the wiki to a GitHub pages website. As of this release the build for nBuildKit
will generate the website using <a href="https://wyam.io">Wyam</a>.</li>

                <div id="post-content">
                    <p>A little while back we finally got fibre in our street. After spending many years on ADSL (we don't
talk about the time of dial-up ...) it was finally time for some decent network speeds at home. As
the fibre was being installed in my house it was also time to evaluate the networking gear I was
using. Until now I had always used the modem / router provided by the ISP with an additional cheap
switch. The gear always worked fine, but didn't provide configuration options other than the ones that
describe the connection to the ISP. As I was starting to use my <a href="./posts/Updating-Hyper-v-server-to-Windows2016">Hyper-V server</a>
a lot more and was starting to run multiple VM's it would be nice to get some better control over
the network. Additionally based on one of <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/no-you-cant-join-my-wifi-network/">Troy Hunt's</a>
blog posts I would also like to set up a separate guest network.</p>
<h3>The selection</h3>
<p>The prolific Troy Hunt has written about his <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/ubiquiti-all-the-things-how-i-finally-fixed-my-dodgy-wifi/">network</a>
setup so I used that as my starting point for finding some new network gear. Fortunately (or unfortunately)
I don't have as much area to cover as Troy does so I didn't need nearly as much hardware. The parts
I got are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ubnt.com/unifi-routing/usg/">Unifi security gateway</a>: The router which provides amongst
other things a firewall, subnet capabilities and DHCP.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ubnt.com/unifi-switching/unifi-switch-8/">Unifi switch 8 (US-8-60W)</a>: The managed switch
which has 4 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet">PoE</a> ports.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ubnt.com/unifi/unifi-ap-ac-lite/">Unifi AP AC LITE</a>: The smallest indoor access point
available from Ubiquiti. Given that my apartment is relatively small I don't have to worry about
covering a lot of area, and smaller access points are cheaper.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ubnt.com/unifi/unifi-cloud-key/">Unifi cloud key</a>: The management device which runs
the Unfi software for managing the network.</li>
</ul>
<p>Except for the cloud key this is pretty much the minimal set of hardware required. The cloud key runs
the unifi software which is used to manage the network configuration. You can install the unifi
software on a PC but then you need an extra PC or VM running. While I have a Hyper-V server it was easier
just to pay for the cloud key and have a separate controller for the network. Note that the network
functions just fine without any configuration. However if you want to make changes the easiest way
to do so is through the unifi software, although you could do it by SSH-ing into each device.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that the the 60W switch has 4 PoE ports of the 802.3af kind. Unfortunately
the access point requires 24V passive PoE. So either you have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Power the access point of the converter that you get with the access point.</li>
<li>Upgrade the access point to the <a href="https://www.ubnt.com/unifi/unifi-ap-ac-pro/">UAP-AC-PRO</a></li>
<li>Upgrade the switch to the <a href="https://www.ubnt.com/unifi-switching/unifi-switch-8-150w/">US-8-150W</a>
switch which has both 802.3af PoE and 24V passive PoE.</li>
</ul>
<p>As much as I would like to power the access point of the switch I still opted for the first option,
the additional investment wasn't quite worth having one less cable around.</p>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>The actual configuration was pretty easy, plug in all the parts and things start working, at least
for the internal network. Once this is done you can configure the network through the unifi software.
To do so the first thing to do is to to find the cloud key. There's a useful plugin for
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ubiquiti-device-discovery/hmpigflbjeapnknladcfphgkemopofig?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog">chrome</a>
that allows you to find any Ubiquiti devices on your local network, otherwise you can try to guess
the IP address of the cloud key. If you only have 4 devices like I do that shouldn't take very long.
The gateway by default assumes you are using the <code>192.168.1.0/24</code> subnet and the gateway is always
the first one.</p>
<p>Once you are logged on to the unifi software it makes sense to give the cloud key a fixed IP address
I gave mine the 192.168.1.2 IP address as I am using the <code>192.168.1.1/24</code> subnet for all my networking
gear. And yes I know I don't have enough networking devices for them to warrant being on their own
subnet but it makes things a little easier and it allows me to learn about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork">subnetting</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN">vlans</a>.</p>
<h3>Subnetting adventures</h3>
<p>As mentioned in the introduction one of the changes I wanted to make was to create a separate guest
network. By default a vlan only guest network is created, however I wanted to move the guests onto
their own subnet so I created a new network with the <code>192.168.5.1/24</code> subnet. I also set the vlan
specifier to <code>1685</code>. And finally I marked this network as a guest network so that the controller
applies the guest firewall rules.</p>
<p>Then I created a wireless guest network with the same vlan. What confused me initially is that there
is no relation between the wireless network and the subnet other than the vlan tag. Somehow having the
same vlan tag is enough to direct the clients onto the the correct subnet.</p>
<p>The last step of the configuration of the guest network is to configure the switch. Because the
access point has three different subnets going to it, the managment subnet for the access point itself,
the guest wifi and the internal wifi, you need to create a custom &lsquo;network&rsquo; on the switch which carries
all three networks, making sure that the untagged network is the one on which you want the access
point to get an IP address.</p>
<p>Another item I found was that for some purposes the standard IP lease of 24 hours is a bit long. One
of the things I'm currently working on is building VM images of different services for use in a test
build environment. While doing that I'm creating <a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse">base boxes</a> for
Windows and Linux which involves spinning up a VM, installing the OS, configuring it and capturing
the image. While working on the code to automate this process I spin up and shut down VMs quite a lot.
If you're using the gateway as the DHCP server and use the standard IP lease time then you run through
IP addresses quite quickly. So I created have a separate IP subnet for those VMs where the IP lease
time is 2 hours (which is more than long enough to create a VM and capture a base image).</p>
<h3>In the end</h3>
<p>In conclusion it's a good set of hardware and software and as a bonus, there are updates which apply
without problems. There is something reassuring in the fact that the manufacturer actually cares enough
about their product that they want to keep it running, unlike much of the consumer gear.</p>
<p>The unifi software provides a lot of useful and interesting capabilities and it's obviously aimed
at the business / educational environment. There are a lot of of features that I don't need, but they
are fun to play with</p>
