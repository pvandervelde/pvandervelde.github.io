                <div id="post-content">
                    <p>As mentioned in my last post I have started tinkering with mobile robots. My current goal is to
build an outdoor capable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_robot">autonomous mobile robot</a>.
The first problem I have to solve in order to move towards my goal is that I know a decent amount
about software, a reasonable amount about structures and mechanics and very little about electronics.
Oh and I know nothing about the robotics algorithms like how navigation works, the fact that robots
may have a hard time
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping">figuring out where they are</a>
and that decision making is hard for robots.</p>
<p>So in order to not have to learn all the things at the same time I decided it would be sensible to
start off buying a kit that I could assemble and learn to work with. The basic requirements were</p>
<ul>
<li>Something that didn't require me to solder electronics or 3d print parts, because I have neither
of those tools, yet ...</li>
<li>Capable of actually carrying a load of some sort. Most robot kits are fun platforms to play with
but other than driving around they're not actually capable of carrying things. I want my robot to
be able to carry things for me.</li>
<li>With accessible hardware and software so that I could modify and extend it.</li>
<li>Affordable, because money is still finite</li>
</ul>
<figure style="float:right">
<img alt="Scuttle assembled" src="/assets/images/robotics/scuttle/scuttle-assembled.jpg" />
<figcaption>SCUTTLE robot assembled</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After a little bit of searching I decided to buy the <a href="https://scuttlerobot.org/">SCUTTLE robot</a> kit.
The SCUTTLE kit is an <a href="https://github.com/scuttlerobot">open source kit</a> for which all the build
information is available online, from the <a href="https://grabcad.com/library/scuttle-robot-v2-3-1">3D drawings</a>
to the material BOM. Additionally there is a lot of sample code that makes it easy to get going with
the robot. There are code samples that allow you to drive the robot with a gamepad or by putting it in
follow mode where it follows a coloured object. Note that when you pick a coloured object apparently
orange is the best colour because of the colour difference with the surroundings. In my case initially
I picked a dark red object in a poorly lit environment with lots of other variations of red around.
You can probably imagine how well that went ...&hellip; [*]</p>
<p>Assembly of the SCUTTLE robot is pretty easy, it consists of aluminium T-slot lengths, some 3D
printed parts and some electronics parts. The T-slot lengths are fastened with angle brackets and
the 3D printed parts bolt to the T-slot lengths. The kit I bought only required connecting electronic parts
with connectors, no soldering required. If you build a SCUTTLE from scratch there is some soldering to
be done.</p>
<p>Once you have assembled your SCUTTLE you can test the functionality by using the code samples to
verify the encoders and the motors. Note that it is wise to review your cabling before turning anything
on because it is possible to connect some of the electronics incorrectly. I ended up breaking my
Raspberry Pi, quite possibly by connecting the encoders backwards or something similar.</p>
<figure style="float:left">
<img alt="Scuttle in RViz" src="/assets/images/robotics/scuttle/scuttle-rviz.png" />
<figcaption>SCUTTLE in RViz</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After verifying that the motors rotate in the correct direction you can try controlling the
robot via the gamepad and drive it around the house.</p>
<p>Currently I'm working to update my SCUTTLE with the <a href="https://www.ros.org/">ROS</a> software. Currently
I'm testing with ROS noetic but I am looking to eventually switch to using ROS2 as it seems to have
a more flexible navigation stack. More on that in a future post.</p>
<p>I'm also planning to add some sensors to my SCUTTLE to make it a bit more autonomous. The first
plan is to add a bumper that will tell the robot if it has hit something. I have picked up some
contact switches but am still thinking about the design for the bumper. Later on I want to add
sonar, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-flight_camera">Time of Flight (ToF) sensors</a> and
potentially cameras as well.</p>
<p>[*] SCUTTLE drove straight at the red coloured couch instead of following the red object I wanted
it to follow</p>

                <div id="post-content">
                    <p>Over the last decade I have been developing software of all kinds. I have coded both for work and
for my own learning and entertainment. The majority of the coding I did over that period was code
that lived only in the virtual world. Things from from numerical simulations to building software
infrastructure.</p>
<p>While I have always greatly enjoyed writing code and learning new skills I have found myself being
less and less interested in writing more code that only lives in a virtual world. It feels like
there is no purpose for this code, like something is missing.</p>
<p>The main thing I feel is missing is interaction with the physical world. The ability to see the
effects of the code when it is executed, to see things move and react to the world. While in
university I studied <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ae">Aerospace engineering</a> and
<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/engineering.html">Mechanical engineering</a>. Two disciplines heavily
involved with real world physics. The fact that a design lives in the physical world adds all kinds
of additional constraints and behaviours. Some of which the result of interesting physical
behaviour and others the result of the continuous and analogue nature of the physical world.
All of this makes the engineering problems more interesting and challenging.</p>
<p>One of the ways I have been incorporating making physical things is by working with timber. I've
build several bits of furniture and generally greatly enjoy working with wood. However working with
wood misses the technological side that I do also enjoy.</p>
<p>A domain that combines both the physical and virtual worlds with large amounts of technology that
recently caught my eye is the world of robotics. As robotics is a combination of many different
fields there is a lot to discover and learn about. Even for the design of a simple robot you will
have to deal with fields like structural mechanics, electronics, software, perception, machine
intelligence etc.. As a bonus thanks to the availability of relatively cheap electronics and
structural components it is possible to build an interesting robot yourself.</p>
<p>My current goal is to build an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_robot">autonomous mobile robot</a>
that is capable of navigating outdoor spaces while carrying some kind of cargo from
one location to another. Before I get to designing and building a robot from the ground
up there are a lot of things to learn. In order to speed up the learning process I
picked up a <a href="https://scuttlerobot.org/">SCUTTLE</a> robot kit and started learning about
<a href="https://www.ros.org/">ROS</a>. More on that will follow in a future post.</p>

                <div id="post-content">
                    <p>One of the final chapters in the description of the development pipeline deals with security. In
this case I specifically mean the security of the pipeline and the underlying infrastructure,
not the security of the applications which are created using the pipeline.</p>
<p>The first question is why should you care about the security of the pipeline? After all
developers use the development pipelines via secured networks and their access permissions will be
set at the source control level. Additionally high trust levels exist between the pipeline
processes, the infrastructure and the source repository. In general this leads to the
security of the pipeline being placed lower on the priority list.</p>
<p>Which issues could you run into if you deem the security of the pipeline less critical? One
argument comes from
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332834111_Vulnerabilities_in_Continuous_Delivery_Pipelines_A_Case_Study">pen tests</a>
which show that CI/CD systems are a great way into
<a href="https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-15/materials/eu-15-Mittal-Continuous-Intrusion-Why-CI-Tools-Are-An-Attackers-Best-Friend.pdf">corporate networks</a>.
Additionally there have been a number of attacks aimed at
<a href="https://medium.com/&#64;hkparker/analysis-of-a-supply-chain-attack-2bd8fa8286ac">distributing</a> malicious
code through trusted software packages. These so called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_attack">supply chain attacks</a> try to compromise the user
by inserting malicious code in third-party dependencies, i.e. the source code supply chain.</p>
<p>In essence the problem comes down to the fact that the build pipeline and its associated infrastructure
have access to many different systems and resources which are normally not easily accessible for
its users. This makes your pipeline a target for malicious actors who could abuse some of the
following states for their own purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li>The development pipeline runs all tasks with the same user account on the executors and thereby
the same permissions. Obviously the worst case scenario would be running as an administrator.</li>
<li>Multiple pipeline invocations executed on a single machine, either in parallel or sequential,
which allows a task in a pipeline to access the workspace of another pipeline. This ability can
for instance be used to by-pass access controls on source code.</li>
<li>Downloading packages directly from external package repositories, e.g. NPM or Docker.</li>
<li>Direct access to the internet, which allows downloading of malicious code and uploading of artefacts
to undesired locations.</li>
<li>The development pipeline has the ability to update or overwrite existing artefacts.</li>
<li>The executors have direct access to different resources that normal pipeline users don't have
access to. Specifically if the same infrastructure is used to build artefacts and
to deploy them to the production environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the problems with securing the development pipeline is that all the actions mentioned above
are in one way or another required for the pipeline to function, after all the pipeline needs to be
able to build and distribute artefacts. The follow up question then becomes can you distinguish between
normal use and malicious use?</p>
<p>It turns out that distinguishing that this will be difficult because both forms of actions are
essentially the same, they both use the development pipeline for its intended purpose. So then in
order to prevent malicious use put up as many barriers to malicious use as possible, aka
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing)">defence in depth</a>. The following are a
number of possible ways to add barriers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grant the minimal possible permissions for the executors, both on the executor and from the executor
to the external resources. It is better to run the pipeline actions as a local user on the executor,
rather than using a domain user. Grant permissions to a specific resource to the action that
interacts with the resource.</li>
<li>Execute a single pipeline per executor and never reuse the executor.</li>
<li>Limit network connections to and from executors. In general executors do not need internet access,
save for a few pre-approved sites, .e.g. an artefact storage. There is also very little reason
for executors to connect to each other, especially if executors are short lived.</li>
<li>Pull packages, e.g. NPM or Docker, only from an internal feed. Additions to the internal feed are made
after the specific package has been reviewed.</li>
<li>The artefacts created with the pipeline should be tracked so that you know the origin, creation time,
storage locations and other data that can help identity an exact instance of an artefact. Under
ideal circumstances you would know exactly which sources and packages were used to create
the artefact as well.</li>
<li>Artefacts should be immutable and never be allowed to overwritten.</li>
<li>Do not use the executors that perform builds for deployments, use a set of executors that only
have deployment permissions but no permissions to source control etc..</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond these changes there are many other ways to reduce the attack surface as documented in the
security literature. In the end the goal of this post is more to point out that the security of the
development pipeline is important, rather than providing ways to make a pipeline more secure. The
exact solutions for pipeline security depend very heavily on the way the pipeline is constructed and
what other forms of security validation have been placed around the pipeline.</p>

                <div id="post-content">
                    <p>The <a href="/posts/Software-development-pipeline-considerations-for-infrastructure-improvements.html">last post</a>
I explained a few ways to improve the development pipeline infrastructure while
keeping downtime minimal. One important consideration for the
<a href="/posts/Software-development-pipeline-Design-resilience.html">resilience</a> of the
pipeline is to reduce the dependencies between the pipeline and the infrastructure.</p>
<p>So what does unwanted coupling between the pipeline and the
infrastructure mean? After all the pipeline code makes assumptions about the capabilities
of the infrastructure it runs on, just like every other piece of code.
For development pipelines examples of unwanted dependencies are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The pipeline is created by using tasks specific to a CI/CD system which means that the artefacts
can only be created on the infrastructure</li>
<li>Pipeline stages expect the outputs from previous stages to be available on the executor,
or worse, they expect the outputs from other pipelines to be on the executor</li>
<li>A pipeline task assumes that certain tools have been installed on the executors</li>
<li>A pipeline task assumes that it has specific permissions on an executor</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two items mentioned impacts the velocity at which development can take place. By relying
completely on the CI/CD system for artefact creation cycle times increases. Additionally
making changes to the pipeline often requires executing it multiple times to debug it.</p>
<p>The second set of items are related to the ease of switching tooling, e.g. when changing vendors
or during disaster recovery. These may or may not be of concern depending on the direction of
development and technology. In my experience vendor lock-in is something to keep in mind if for no
other reason then that switching vendors can be prohibitively complicated if pipeline processes are
too tightly coupled to the CI/CD system.</p>
<p>If any of the issues mentioned are concerning to you then partially or completely decoupling
the development pipeline from the infrastructure will be a worthwhile exercise. This
can be achieved with some of the following steps.</p>
<h4>Versions for everybody</h4>
<p>Ensure that all code, tools, scripts and resources used in the pipeline are versioned. That way you
know exactly what is required for a specific pipeline execution. Which make executions repeatable
in the future when newer versions of tools and resources have been released.</p>
<h4>Only the workspace is yours</h4>
<p>Pipeline actions should work only in their own workspace. Any code, scripts or tools they require
are put in the workspace. This reduces scattering of data during the execution of a pipeline and
reduces pollution of the executors.</p>
<h4>Lean executors</h4>
<p>Make your pipeline actions assume they will run on a bare minimum runtime. This will
ensure that your pipelines will obtain their preferred version of tools they need and
install them in their own workspace. The benefit of doing this that a pipeline can be executed on
any available executor, either in your CI/CD system or on a developer machine, as it will not be
making any assumptions about the capabilities of an executor.</p>
<h4>Single use executors are cleaner</h4>
<p>Configure the CI/CD system to use a clean executor for every job. This will ensure that changes made
during a previous job don't interfere with the current job. Additionally it will enforce the use of
immutable infrastructure for the executors, thus allowing versioning of the executors.</p>
<h4>Use the CI/CD system as a task executor</h4>
<p>Keep the configuration for the jobs in the CI/CD system to a minimum. Ideally the entire configuration
is the execution of a script or tools with a simple set of arguments. By reducing the job of the
CI/CD system to executing a script or tool it is simple to execute the pipeline actions somewhere
else, e.g. on a developer machine or a different CI/CD system.</p>
<h4>Treat pipeline services as critical</h4>
<p>All services used by the pipeline should be treated as mission critical systems. After all a failure
in one of these systems can stop all your pipelines from executing. So reduce the number of services
you use in your pipeline and improve the resilience the services you have to rely on using the standard
approaches.</p>

                </div>
                <div id="post-content">
                    <p>This post introduces the <a href="https://www.calvinverse.net/">Calvinverse</a>
<a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse">project</a> which provides the source code for the different resources
required to create the infrastructure for a build pipeline. The Calvinverse resources have been
developed for two main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide me with a way to experiment with and learn more about
<a href="https://thenewstack.io/a-brief-look-at-immutable-infrastructure-and-why-it-is-such-a-quest/">immutable</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jezhumble/status/970334897544900609">infrastructure</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code">infrastructure-as-code</a> as applied to build infrastructure.</li>
<li>To provide resources that can be used to set up the infrastructure for a complete
<a href="/posts/On-prem-vs-cloud-build-systems">on-prem</a> build system. The system should provide a build
controller with build agents, artefact storage and all the necessary tools to monitor the different
services and diagnose issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Calvinverse resources can be configured and deployed for different sizes of infrastructure, from
small setups only used by a few developers to a large setup used by many developers for the development
of many products. How to configure the resources for small, medium or large environments and their
hardware requirements will be discussed in future posts.</p>
<p>The resources in the Calvinverse project are designed to be run as a self-contained system. While
daily maintenance is minimal it is not a hosted system so some maintenance is required. For instance
OS updates will be required on a regular basis. These can either be applied to existing resources,
through the automatic updates, or by applying the new updates to the templates and then replacing
the existing resources with a new instance. The latter approach case can be automated, however there
is no code in any of the Calvinverse repositories to do this automatically.</p>
<p>The different resources in the Calvinverse project contain a set of tools and applications which
provide all the necessary capabilities to create the infrastructure for a build pipeline. Amongst these
capabilities are service discovery, build execution, artefact storage, metrics, alerting and
log processing.</p>
<p>The following applications and approaches are used for service discovery and configuration storage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using <a href="https://www.consul.io">Consul</a> to provide service discovery and machine discovery via
<a href="https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/dns.html">DNS</a> inside an environment. An environment is defined
as all machines that are part of a <a href="https://www.consul.io/docs/internals/architecture.html">consul datacenter</a>.
It is possible to have multiple environments where the machines may all be on the same network but
in general will not be communicating across environments. This is useful for cases where having
multiple environments makes sense, for instance when having a production environment and a test
environment. The benefit of using Consul as a DNS is that it allows a resource to have a consistent
name across different environments without the DNS names clashing. For instance if there is a
production environment and a test environment then it is possible to use the same DNS name
for a resource, even though the actual machine names will be different. This allows using the
Consul DNS name in tools and scripts without having to keep in mind the environment the tool
is deployed in.
Finally Consul is also used for the distributed key-value store that all applications can obtain
configuration information from thereby centralizing the configuration information.</li>
<li>Using one or more <a href="https://vaultproject.io">Vault</a> instance to handle all the secrets required
for the environment. Vault provides authenticated access for resources to securely access secrets,
login credentials and other information that should be kept secure. This allows centralizing the
storage and distribution of secrets</li>
</ul>
<p>For the build work Calvinverse uses the following applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jenkins.io">Jenkins</a> is used as the
<a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/resource.build.master">build controller</a>.</li>
<li>Build executors connect to Jenkins using the <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/swarm">swarm plugin</a> so
that agents can connect when it starts. In the Calvinverse project there are currently only
<a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/resource.build.agent.windows">Windows</a> based executors.</li>
</ul>
<p>For <a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/resource.artefacts">artefact storage</a> Calvin verse uses the
<a href="https://www.sonatype.com/nexus-repository-oss">Nexus</a> application. The image is configured such that
a new instance of the image will create artefact repositories for <a href="https://www.nuget.org">NuGet</a>,
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">Npm</a>, <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> and general ZIP artefacts.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/resource.queue">message distribution</a> Calvinverse uses the <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a> application. The image is configured such that a new instance of the image will
try to connect to the existing cluster in the environment. If no cluster exists then the first
instance of the image will form the start of the cluster in the environment.</p>
<p>Metrics, monitoring and alerting capabilities are provided by the
<a href="https://www.influxdata.com/">Influx</a> stack, consisting of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/">InfluxDB</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/resource.metrics.storage">metrics collection</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> for <a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/resource.metrics.dashboard">dashboards</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">Telegraf</a> is installed on each resource to collect metrics and send
them to InfluxDb.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/chronograf/">Chronograf</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/resource.metrics.monitoring">alert configurations</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/kapacitor/">Kapacitor</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/resource.metrics.monitoring">alerting</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Build and system logs are processed by the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elastic</a> stack consisting off:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/resource.documents.storage">log storage</a>, both system logs
and build logs</li>
<li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana">Kibana</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/resource.documents.dashboard">log dashboards</a>.</li>
<li>Logs collected via <a href="https://www.syslog-ng.com/products/open-source-log-management/">syslog-ng</a> on
Linux and a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/pvandervelde/filebeat.mqtt">Filebeat</a> on windows.
Logs are sent to RabbitMQ to ensure that the unprocessed logs aren't lost when something any part
of the log stack goes offline.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash">Logstash</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/resource.logs.processor">processing logs</a> from RabbitMQ to
Elasticsearch using <a href="https://github.com/Calvinverse/calvinverse.logs.filters">filters</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It should be noted that while the Calvinverse resources combine to create a complete build environment
the resources might need some alterations to fit in with the work flow and processes that are being
followed. After all each company is different and applies different workflows. Additionally users
might want to replace some of the resources with versions of their own, e.g. to replace Influx with
<a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a>.</p>
