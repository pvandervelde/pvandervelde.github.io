                <div id="post-content">
                    <p>In order to deliver new or improved software applications within the desired
time span while maintaining or improving quality modern development moves towards
<a href="https://techbeacon.com/doing-continuous-delivery-focus-first-reducing-release-cycle-times">shorter development and delivery</a>
cycles. This is often achieved through the use of agile processes and a development
workflow including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">Continuous Integration</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery">Continuous Delivery</a>
or even <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/continuous-deployment">Continuous deployment</a>.</p>
<p>One of the consequences of this desire to reduce the development cycle time on the
development process is that more tasks in the development workflow
have to be automated in order to reduce the time taken for the specific task.
One way this automation can be achieved is by creating a
<a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1621865&amp;seqNum=2">development pipeline</a> which
takes the source code and moves it through a set of largely automatic transformations, e.g. compilation,
testing, packaging and potentially deployment, to obtain a validated, and potentially deployed, application.</p>
<p>In order to configure a development pipeline, whether that is on-prem or in the cloud, for
one or more development teams one will have to understand what the requirements are which
are placed on the pipeline, which tooling is available to create the pipeline, whether the
pipeline will be situated on-prem, in the cloud or a combination and
how the pipeline will be assembled and managed. In this post series some of
these issues will be discussed starting with the requirements or considerations that need
to be given to the characteristics or behaviours of the development pipeline.</p>
<p>Prior to discussing what the considerations are for selecting tooling and infrastructure
for a development pipeline, it is important to decide what elements are part of the pipeline
and which elements are not. For the remainder of this
post series the development pipeline is considered to consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The scripts that are used during the different parts of the cycle, i.e. the build, test
and release scripts.</li>
<li>The continuous integration system which is used to execute the different scripts.</li>
<li>The tools, like the compiler, test frameworks, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Items like version control, package management, issue tracking, system monitoring,
customer support and others are not included in the discussion. While these systems
are essential in application development and deployment each of these systems spans
a large enough area that it warrants a more thorough discussion than can be given in
this post series.</p>
<p>Additionally, the following terms will be used throughout the series:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input set - A collection of information that is provided to the pipeline to start
the process of turning these generating the desired artefacts. An input set may consist
of source code, e.g. in terms of a given commit to the source control system, files or
documents, configuration values or any other combination of information which is required
to create, validate and deploy the product artefacts.
An input set should contain all the information needed to generate and deploy the product
artefacts and each time a specific input set is provided to the pipeline exactly the
same artefacts will be produced.</li>
<li>Executor - In general the development pipeline will be driven by a continuous integration
system which itself consists of a controlling unit, which receives the tasks and distributes them,
and a set of executing units which perform the actual computational tasks. In small systems
the controlling unit may also perform the computational tasks, however even in this case
a distinction can be made between the controlling and executing parts.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to start the selection of suitable components for a development pipeline
it is important to know what the desirable properties of such a system are. The following
ordered properties are thought to be the most important ones to consider.</p>
<ul>
<li>Correctness: The pipeline must return the right outputs for a specific input, i.e it
should report errors to the interested parties if there are any and report success
and produce the desired artefacts if there are no errors.</li>
<li>Performance: The pipeline must push changes through the different stages fast
in order to get results back to the interested parties as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Robustness: The pipeline must be able to cope with environmental changes, both expected
and unexpected.</li>
<li>Flexibility: The pipeline must be easy to adapt to new products and tools so that it can
be used without having to replace large parts each time a new product or tool needs to
be included.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are of course other desirable properties for a development pipeline like ease-of-use,
maintainability, etc.. It is however considered that the aforementioned properties are the
most critical ones. The linked posts provide additional reasons why each of these properties
are important and how a software development pipeline can be designed to satisfy these important
considerations.</p>

                </div>
                <div id="post-content">
                    <p>Version <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/releases/tag/0.10.0">0.10.0</a>
and version <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/releases/tag/0.10.1">0.10.1</a>
of <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild">nBuildKit</a>
have been released. The <code>0.10.0</code> release is the first release in the stabilization
cycle. There are still a few major changes but the goal is to start stabilizing nBuildKit
in preparation for the 1.0.0 release.</p>
<p>The highlights are</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/308">Renamed</a> <code>DirTest</code> to <code>DirTests</code>.
This is a <em>breaking</em> change.</li>
<li>Additional <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/248">meta data</a> can
be provided with the build, test and deploy steps to indicate if a step should be inserted
before or after another step in the sequence. Steps which have no insertion limits, i.e
those steps that do not have the before or after meta data set, are inserted in document order.
Steps that do define insertion limits are inserted according to the limits. Note that
circular limits are not allowed as well as step sequences where there are no steps without
insertion limits.</li>
<li>Deploying artefacts to an <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/303">HTTP server</a></li>
<li>Initial implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/296">ability to verify GPG hash signatures</a>.
The current implementation requires that the GPG tooling is allowed through the firewall.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the major changes some additional build, test and deploy steps have also been defined:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addition of properties that indicate <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/304">which stage the script is currently executing</a>. The
new properties are <code>IsBuild</code>, <code>IsTest</code> and <code>IsDeploy</code></li>
<li>Allowing <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/306">template variables</a> in the
path and <code>destination</code> of the <code>ArchiveFilesToCopy</code> item group.</li>
<li>Migrated the <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/297">hash calculation functions</a>
from <a href="https://github.com/ops-resource/ops-tools-build">Ops-Tools-Build</a>.</li>
</ul>

                    <p>Version <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/releases/tag/0.9.2">0.9.2</a>
of <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild">nBuildKit</a> has been released. This release fixes
a number of bugs and adds a few new improvements</p>
<p>All the work items that have been closed for this release can be found on

<h3>Bugs fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/280">280</a> - The <code>deploy.pushto.gitbranch</code>
script called the <code>GitCurrentBranch</code> task with a <code>WorkingDirectory</code> property which did not exist,
thus causing the pushing to a git branch deployment step to fail.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/281">281</a> - The <code>deploy.pushto.gitbranch</code>
script did not create the directory into which the repository should be cloned. This caused the
step to fail.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/286">286</a> - The <code>GenerateTargetsFile</code> custom
task applied a custom assembly resolver which did not resolve references to the MsBuild assemblies.
This is a problem for MsBuild 15.0 and higher because from that version onwards the MsBuild assemblies,
e.g. <code>Microsoft.Build.XX</code> are no longer located in the GAC and can thus not be found by the standard
assembly resolver.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/287">287</a> - The <code>shared.prepare.copy.files</code>
task did not correctly copy the directory hierarchy.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/290">290</a> - The <code>build.prepare.generatefiles</code>
script only generated the files if they did not exist. This has been changed so that generated
files are always created and updated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/254">254</a> - All warnings and errors have been
given a proper error code for easier parsing of errors from the log.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/282">282</a> - The Git, Powershell and NuGet
base tasks have been moved to the Core targets assembly so that they can be used in third party
custom tasks as well.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/284">284</a> - A new task has been added that
allows extracting files from one or more ZIP archive files.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/285">285</a> - Additional conditions have been
added to all <code>ItemGroup</code> elements to ensure that these item groups are only loaded when they are
required. This reduces build times and improves stability.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/288">288</a> - A new task has been added that
allows downloading files from a HTTP URL. If the file in question is an archive file it can
additionally be unzipped before the final copy takes place.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally the first steps to better documentation have been taken. The <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/blob/master/README.md">readme</a>,
the <a href="http://nbuildkit.github.io/nBuildKit.MsBuild/">introduction</a> and the <a href="http://nbuildkit.github.io/nBuildKit.MsBuild/docs/contributing">contributing</a>
documents have been updated.</p>
