    </p>
</div>

                </div>
                <div id="post-content">
                    <p>Version <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/releases/tag/0.9.0">0.9.0</a> of <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild">nBuildKit</a>
has been released. The last release I talked about on this blog was <a href="posts/nBuildKit-release-V051">0.5.1</a>.
Since then a <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/releases">lot more versions</a> have been
released. The <code>0.9.0</code> release was supposed to be a stabilization release but there were many major
improvements which makes this a major change release.</p>
<p>The highlights are</p>
<ul>
<li>The settings describing artefacts, e.g. the nuspec and zip archive files to build, have moved to
a <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/215">separate file</a> <code>artefacts.settings.props</code>.
This allows each of the different stages, build, test and release, to easily use these settings
without having to load configuration files from the other stages.</li>
<li>All user specific configuration files now have a <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/224">version number</a>
which indicates for which version of nBuildKit they were created. This will allow nBuildKit to
transform older configuration files prior to using them.</li>
<li>The inline tasks have been <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/230">moved to a .NET assembly</a>.
This simplifies the project includes that need to be made to get all the required tasks loaded.
Additionally more complex tasks can be created and <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/234">unit tests can be written and executed</a>
which should improve the quality of the tasks.</li>
<li>User <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/191">defined location</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/192">transformation</a> of the configuration
files prior to starting the build. In combination with the version numbers in the configuration
files this allows nBuildKit to use configuration files from a previous version while still using
the most recent version of nBuildKit. Note that it is currently not possible to upgrade the old
(0.8.3 and prior) configurations to 0.9.0 this way.</li>
<li>Build, test and deploy steps can define <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/196">pre- and post-steps</a>
which are executed before and after the execution of the step. Additionally global pre- and post-steps
can be defined which areo executed before and after each step. These pre- and post-steps can for
instance be used to <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/185">write information to a log file</a>
or to gather post step information.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/206">build server specific code</a> was
moved into separate NuGet packages so that these can be pulled down on the build server only. Three
different packages have been created for <a href="https://jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a>,
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms181709%28v=vs.120%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396">TFS2013</a>
and <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/build/overview">TFS2015 / TFS2017</a>.</li>
<li>The layout of the scripts and NuGet packages has changed so that it is easier to create a
<a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/220">new set of build tools based on nBuildKit</a>.
With this change it is now possible to create a build / test / deploy library that includes all or
some of the nBuildKit capabilities while providing its own additional capabilities. An example is
the <a href="https://github.com/ops-resource/ops-tools-build">ops-tools-build</a> library which is being used
in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_Code">infrastructure-as-code</a> work I'm doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the major changes some additional build, test and deploy steps have also been defined:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete a <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow">gitflow</a>
stage, e.g. finishing the feature, hotfix or release branch, to verify that the pending merge will
not break the build. Additionally the results of the merge can be captured, by archiving the
<code>.git</code> folder, and can later be used in the deploy process to push the merge to a git remote.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/255">Copying files</a> from the file system or
from a NuGet package.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/238">ILMerge</a> one or more assemblies into a
target assembly.</li>
<li>Generating a targets file from an assembly containing MsBuild tasks.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/146">Invoking</a> <a href="https://wyam.io">Wyam</a>
during the build process. Note that this is a late addition and hasn't been tested completely yet</li>
<li>Invoking <a href="https://github.com/pester/Pester">Pester</a> during the test phase.</li>
<li>Pushing files to a git branch during the deploy stage.</li>
<li>Pushing an entire repository to a git remote during the deploy stage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally the performance of the whole build process has been improved by changing how the template
tokens are <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/issues/242">generated and loaded</a>. The
overall speed up for the nBuildKit build itself is about a factor two.</p>

    </p>
</div>

                </div>
                <div id="post-content">
                    <p>One of the computers I have in my home is a Hyper-V server which I use to experiment with all things
virtual machines, e.g. <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/infrastructure-code-reason-smile">infrastructure-as-code</a>.
This server was until recently running Windows 2012R2 with the associated version of Hyper-V. With
the release of Windows 2016 a new version of Hyper-V was available which had some interesting
features, like <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/nested-virtualization">nested virtualization</a>
which allows running VMs on VMs and running Hyper-V containers. All in all enough interesting features
to warrant upgrading my server.</p>
<p>There are however some issues to deal with. The first one being, which version of Windows 2016 are
we going to install? The ideal version to install would be the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/hyper-v-server-docs/hyper-v-server-2016?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396">bare metal Hyper-V</a>
option with <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server-docs/get-started/windows-server-2016">Windows 2016 server Core</a>
being the second best option. The problem with these version is that it might be harder to
configure the network and attach the machine to the active directory. I currently don't have enough
experience managing Windows through (remote) powershell in order to be able to resolve those kinds
of issues without a large amount of help from Google or Bing. The goal for this exercise is to get
the machine updated so that we can use it, not to get the most lean version of Windows installed, so
I opted to go for the full GUI version of Windows 2016.</p>
<p>To make things more interesting my Active Directory server is a VM running on the Hyper-V server.
And yes I know there should be at least two Active Directory servers on different physical machines
but until I have lots of money and can afford to have multiple servers in my house I will work
with having a single AD server.</p>
<p>The approach I followed to upgrade the operating system on my server to Windows 2016 was as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make backups of everything and be ready to spend some time restoring the AD server, i.e. this is
probably better done as a weekend job.</li>
<li>Create a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/windows-usb-dvd-download-tool">bootable USB</a>
with the Windows2016 installer.</li>
<li>Attach a keyboard, mouse and monitor to the server so that we can log in to the server directly.
Installing Windows remotely is not possible with my local configuration.</li>
<li>Insert the USB drive, reboot the server and make sure it boots from the USB key</li>
<li>After the Windows installation starts make sure to remove the existing partitions on the original
OS drive. While the OS could be upgraded that also leaves a lot of unused files around. Unfortunately
in that case it will be hard to determine if these files can be deleted or not. By doing a clean
install we can be sure that there will not be any left-overs from the upgrade.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the new operating system is installed the next step is to restore the VMs. Because all the
VM information was stored on physically different disks than the OS disk all the virtual hard drives
and VM configuration files still exist. In this case it is easy to import the old virtual machines
via the Hyper-V manager.</p>
<p>Once all the VMs were up and running again the last step was to attach the Hyper-V machine to the
domain so that it is easy to use the remote desktop capabilities. Now attaching the machine to
the domain is easy, the problem occurs when you have to restart the Hyper-V machine because after
the reboot the network connection will be set to the public profile instead of the domain profile
which means remote desktop and friends are all blocked. This is all caused by the fact that when the
Hyper-V machine boots up it doesn't have connection to the AD server, because that is a VM running
on the Hyper-V machine, and thus the network profile is set to be public for security purposes.</p>
<p>In order to fix this we need to either force the <a href="https://newsignature.com/articles/network-location-awareness-service-can-ruin-day-fix/">Network Location Awareness service</a> to run
after the AD server has started, or we need to restart the service after a short period. In my case
setting the service start in delayed mode didn't really work so I created a scheduled task which
restarted the service by calling the following command line</p>
<pre><code>C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -noprofile -nologo -command &quot;restart-service nlasvc -force&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Over all the upgrade was easier than I thought and there were only minor set backs. Some of the lessons
that were learned are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideally for jobs like this you would have an extra keyboard, mouse and monitor around, that way you
can still use the normal PC for googling issues that you come across.</li>
<li>Importing old VMs in Hyper-V is easy as long as you make sure that you know where all the files
are.</li>
<li>Ideally you would have multiple AD servers, running of different physical machines. Then again
ideally I'd also have lots of money to pay for all these physical machines 😉</li>
</ul>

                <div id="post-content">
                    <p>One part of <a href="/posts/Goals-for-2017">improving my career and increasing my professional reach</a> is to
post more to this blog about the work that I am doing and the code and skills that come from this
work. Unfortunately at the moment writing is still more of a chore than it is a pleasure so that
means that if I want to publish more I need to make it very easy for me to do so, otherwise the publishing
process will just add yet another obstacle that I need to get past while producing content.</p>
<p>With me being a build engineer by profession the obvious solution was not to follow the
<a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/its-a-new-blog/">sensible path</a> of a managed system but to create some
kind of build system to automatically build and publish my blog posts. Troy Hunt is right in
that a managed system is far quicker and easier to use, thereby saving time that you can use for
improvements elsewhere. In my case however I feel that there is something additional to be gotten from
setting my blog up to be automatically build and deployed. To be specific additional learning experiences,
more knowledge and a new blog post about how I achieved the goal. I hope that those things will
make up for the extra work I have to do in maintaining my own blog.</p>
<p>So the goals for this project were</p>
<ul>
<li>Build every time I push to the <a href="https://github.com/pvandervelde/mindvortex">source repository</a> on
an independent environment so that I can be sure that I can always build my blog and nothing is
dependent on my machine being available.</li>
<li>Publishing should involve a minimal amount of work done from my side. Ideally all I would have to
do is commit my changes, merge them to the <a href="https://github.com/pvandervelde/mindvortex">master branch</a>
of the source repository and then sit back and see the new post appear online.</li>
<li>No maintenance is necessary for what ever system I use to achive this goal. When I build new versions
of one of my libraries, applications or infrastructure resources I want full control over the
build, test and deployment environments. For building my blog that is far less important because
it is a simple process which does not require many different steps.</li>
<li>Finally it would be nice to make it interesting enough to get a blog post out of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>After a few hours of tinkering that is where we are now, this blog post was build and published
using a combination of <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/">AppVeyor</a> as the build server and
<a href="/projects/nBuildKit">nBuildKit</a> for the build and deploy scripts.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this the first step that I took was to set up the build scripts so that I could
build on my local machine. Having a build that executes in the same way on a developer machine
and the build server has many benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li>Familiarity: developers understand what the build server does because it works exactly as on their
machine.</li>
<li>Ease of debugging: it is easier to discover the source of any errors if you can execute the scripts
on a developers machine because then you have have full access to the workspace which may not be
the case on a build machine.</li>
<li>Ease of testing: even build scripts need to be tested. If this is done on a developer machine then
the testing will most likely be able to be executed much quicker because there is less need to
commit every change, push it to the server and wait for the build server to execute the build.</li>
</ul>
<p>Configuring <code>nBuildKit</code> means copying the <a href="https://github.com/nbuildkit/nBuildKit.MsBuild/tree/master/src/samples">sample files</a>
to the root of the workspace and updating them with values relevant to the project.</p>
<p>In this case I updated the <code>settings.props</code> file, which contains the general information about the
build, test and deploy processes, with <a href="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/88aa8f644148b4cdb9fa909fe3ff8f69">product information</a>.</p>
<p>I also <a href="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/9853b15889ccf67bafa5fa2e93594ca2">enabled the automatic merging</a>
for the <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">GitFlow</a> process. This allows
nBuildKit to automatically complete feature, hotfix and release branches when running on a build
server so that each build also verifies that the final merge will be successful and the changes will
not break anything after the merge.</p>
<p>The next file to update was the <code>build.settings.props</code> file, which describes what needs to be done
during the build process, was updated. The first part of that was to define which <a href="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/015611f5355b07e1b3246ae81bf2ea0a">steps should be
taken during the build process</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear the workspace. While this is not necessary on a build server, after all a fresh workspace
is used for each build, it is necessary on a developer machine because old artefacts may still
be present.</li>
<li>Ensure that the build server has configured the workspace with the correct source control information.
Many build systems do not perform a full clone at the start of a build but rather get only the
minimal source control information in addition to the source files. This reduces time and IO
demands, especially for repositories with extensive history. Different build systems have a
different approach to what steps exactly are taken. The lack of source control information, e.g.
the state of different branches, or the branch that the current commit is part of, is not a
problem if the only step is to compiling code however issues can occur if the state of the local
workspace is used to determine version numbers or VCS information. In those cases it is better to
ensure that the workspace is in the same state as it was on the developers machine.</li>
<li>Gather VCS information like the current commit ID and the branch name. For my blog this information
is embedded in the footer of every page to indicate which commit was build and what version
of the blog you are looking at.</li>
<li>Complete the active <code>GitFlow</code> branch, if there is one, by merging the active branch to the
appropriate target branches and adding tags if necessary.</li>
<li>Get version information with <a href="https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion">GitVersion</a>. This
is done after the merge process so that the version number is the release version.</li>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/813a19ff4861470ba03591a5ecc4b910">Build the pages</a> with Wyam.</li>
<li>Zip up the generated pages</li>
</ul>
<p>The final change to the <code>build.settings.props</code> file was to enable the generation of the archive
files by <a href="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/d1ec2c78fc560bd20ef1ef7a375eee30">uncommenting the <code>ArchivePackageSpecs</code> section</a>.</p>
<p>The last file to be changed was the <code>deploy.settings.props</code> file which describes what needs to be
done during the deploy process. As with the <code>build.settings.props</code> file the first step here was
to select the <a href="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/8ee5a1dc96d0835bb8b3aa6354896ba7">steps that should be taken during the deploy process</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once again ensure that the build server workspace is configured with the correct source control
information.</li>
<li>Gather version information in the same way as was done during the build process.</li>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/c6490e33fd73d0f7afc15677a4bf2e8b">Push the archive files</a>
to AppVeyor.</li>
<li>Push the files contained in the archive file to the <a href="https://github.com/pvandervelde/pvandervelde.github.io">repository</a>
that contains the generated pages. This was simply done by enabling the <code>DeployStepsPushToGitBranch</code>
deploy step and <a href="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/9a2dd811faf4d0e56ef3b5069d2e7d3c">providing information about the repository and branch</a>
that the files should be pushed to. The commit message for this process currently comes from a text
file in the root of the repository. Ideally there would be some way to discover a decent commit
message, e.g. the name of the most recent post, however many different changes are pushed to the
source repository so selecting the correct commit message is somewhat difficult.</li>
</ul>
<p>By updating these three files we have provided <code>nBuildKit</code> with enough information to execute both
the build and deploy processes.</p>
<p>Once the build scripts were complete and tested the only thing that remained was to configure
AppVeyor. This can either be done through the <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/docs/build-configuration/">UI or a YAML file</a>.
In this case I elected to use the <a href="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/4171a3b81776132e2800a3f9b802fa43">YAML file</a>
so that all information describing my build and deployment process would exist in the repository.</p>
<p>In order to create the configuration file I copied the <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/docs/appveyor-yml/">reference file</a>
and then removed all the bits I didn't need. The only tricky bit was setting up the AppVeyor
environment so that the deploy process could push the final results back to GitHub. For that I
added a <a href="https://github.com/blog/2024-read-only-deploy-keys">deploy key</a> to the target repository.
The private part of this key was then encrypted and placed in the YAML file. Some <code>before_deploy</code>
<a href="https://www.appveyor.com/docs/how-to/private-git-sub-modules/">script magic</a> allows the decryption
of the key so that git can push the changes to the repository via SSH.</p>

                </div>
                <div id="post-content">
                    <p>In 2016 set myself a bunch of goals for the year for different areas of my life. Of all the goals
I only managed to achieve one successfully but am still pretty happy with how the year turned
out. Overall improvements were made and new things were learned so what that concerns it was
a successful year.</p>
<p>Given that setting goals did sort of work for me in 2016 going into 2017 I decided to do this again
and set some goals in order to actively progress in different areas. This time I also decided to
write the goals down somewhere public.</p>
<p>For 2017 my goals are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Improve my overall fitness while maintaining my weight at or below 80kg.</p>
<p>In 2016 my goal was to improve my fitness and lose some weight. Due to a shoulder and elbow injury
I actually gained weight in the first half of the year but over the course of the last 6 months
I managed to lose about 5kgs thanks to a lot of exercise and an improvement in my eating habits.
As a bonus I gained a lot of strength and general endurance. Overall these improvements have made
me feel a lot better, have a more defined set of muscles and helped me in my outdoor spot pursuits
as well.</p>
<p>For 2017 the goal is to keep the weight the same, just below 80kgs, while improving my general
strength and fitness.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make my career independent from my job</p>
<p>The last two years I have been working for <a href="https://vista.co">Vista</a> as a software / build engineer
responsible for the development tooling and infrastructure. While this has been a bit of a change
from my previous jobs as software developer it has been a great experience. I have learned about
many new technologies, created some awesome tooling and have many more things still to learn and
create. However with this change from general developer to more of an internal tooling / infrastructure
person it has also become clear to me that my technical capabilities will improve more if I make
my toughts, opinions and code available for public scrutiny by the larger development community.
I already have a <a href="/projects">number of open source projects</a> but for 2017 I also plan to write
and potentially speak more about the things I'm working on. One part of that is re-re-activating
my blog and writing new posts about some of the cool technologies I'm currently working with and on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Simplify life and my surroundings.</p>
<p>The first few years after I moved to New Zealand I didn't have very much in the way of material
possessions, after all I had just moved to the other side of the world with only the things I could
take on the airplane. Additionally I moved almost every year to a new house so getting rid of
useless possessions meant I had to move less stuff from the old house to the new one. Over time
though I have acquired more things both materially and in habits. Some of those things are
<a href="/tags/paragliding">highly</a> <a href="/tags/climbing">prized</a> however some things are a waste of time and
space. The goal for 2017 is to minimize the amount of useless stuff I have, like pieces of furniture
which are never used, and useless things I do so that there is  more time and space to spend on
things that are useful and improve my life.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Improve my confidence, in general in life but especially for climbing and paragliding</p>
<p>In general in life having confidence in yourself and your skills is important. For my outdoor
activities, climbing and paragliding, it is even more important. Without confidence in yourself and
your skils it is not possible to perform well in either activity. Due to injuries and some
intense experiences my confidence in either my climbing or flying skills isn't very high at the
moment so 2017 is the year that I will do my utmost best to improve my confidence in my professional
skills, my climbing and paragliding capabilities and life in general.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sports / achievment goals</p>
<p>The final goals for 2017, at least as far as this list goes, is to actively improve my skils
in climbing and flying.</p>
<p>For a while I have been trying to improve my climbing skills, strength and endurance enough to
be able to climb a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing)">grade 24</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_climbing">sports climb</a>. So for 2017 that will be my goal, to
improve enoguh to finally be able to climb a 24. Additionally over the last few years I have been
doing more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_climbing">trad climbing</a> I am also going to
try to improve my skills in that area by setting myself a goal of climbing a grade 20 on trad.</p>
<p>In my other outdoor activity, paragliding, the general goals are related to the distance your
can fly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragliding#Cross-country_flying">cross country (XC)</a>. As I
have so far not managed to get away from launch at all my goal for 2017 is to do an XC flight of
more than 5km.</p>
</li>
</ul>

                <div id="post-content">
                    <p>After not having done anything with my blog for over a year I have returned and will once again try
to make this blogging thing happen. Part of my goals for 2017 is to start advancing my career
independent from my job. And one part of that goal is to blog about all the things I'm learning.</p>
<p>For about a year and a half <a href="http://docpad.org/">Docpad</a> has been very helpful in adding content to
my blog, however as I was trying to automate my blog more and more I came to the conclusion that
being on a Windows operating system doesn't make dealing with node and NPM any easier. So I figured
it might make sense to switch to a <a href="">static generator</a> which uses technologies that play better on
Windows. Enter <a href="https://wyam.io">Wyam</a>, a static generator written in .NET, a technology stack
I'm very familiar with.</p>
<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>To get started with Wyam I downloaded the latest version and generated a skeleton directory structure
by running the <code>wyam.exe new --recipe Blog</code> command. Once the skeleton has been created you can
create the pages by running <code>wyam.exe -r Blog -t CleanBlog</code>, and to create and be able to view
the pages you can execute <code>wyam -r Blog -t CleanBlog -p</code>. These commands assume that you store
your blog source in the <code>input</code> directory and that the website pages should be placed in the
<code>output</code> directory. This however is where the build engineer in me started making
disapproving sounds so I changed the input and output folders by specifying the appropriate command line
parameters to make it happy again</p>
<pre><code>wyam.exe --input src --output build\site -r Blog -t CleanBlog -p
</code></pre>
<p>Good that is much more inline with the standard paths used by <a href="/projects/nbuildkit">nBuildKit</a>.
Another change that needs to be made is where Wyam stores the NuGet packages. Normally Wyam stores
those in a global location, however I strongly feel that builds should always only write to their
local workspaces, so lets redirect the packages to a folder that is local to the workspaces</p>
<pre><code>wyam.exe --input src --output build\site --use-local-packages --packages-path packages -r Blog -t CleanBlog -p
</code></pre>
<p>That command line is getting longer but we can make it shorter again by moving some of the
standard items into the <a href="https://wyam.io/docs/usage/configuration">Wyam configuration file</a>, so
I created a <code>config.wyam</code> file in the root of the workspace and added the following lines</p>
<pre><code>// Preprocessor directives
#recipe Blog
#theme CleanBlog
</code></pre>
<p>And with this the command line to generate the website and start a local webserver is</p>
<pre><code>wyam.exe --input src --output build\site --use-local-packages --packages-path packages
</code></pre>
<h3>Moving the existing content</h3>
<p>Moving the existing content from the Docpad generated site to the Wyam generated site required a bit
of work although the initial results were quite easy to achieve. I started off moving the
post files to the <code>posts</code> directory and updating all the files to be named so that Wyam is able
to extract the date and time from the file name. In order for that to work Wyam wants the file
name to follow the naming convention <code>&lt;YEAR&gt;-&lt;MONTH&gt;-&lt;DAY&gt;-&lt;TITLE&gt;.md</code>.</p>
<p>The next step was to update the front matter in the post files. Wyam would like to see the
following format:</p>
<pre><code>Title: &lt;POST_TITLE_GOES_HERE&gt;
Tags:
  - &lt;TAG_1&gt;
  - &lt;TAG_2&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>With this done Wyam can generate a website with blog posts with the correct titles and dates. This
is a good start. Next are the non-post pages, like the <a href="/">home page</a> and the <a href="/projects">project pages</a>.
These can simply be dropped in the desired directory. Wyam will automatically generate HTML pages
from any Markdown file and simply copy the other files (like the favicon etc.). Any non-blog post
pages will show up in the menu bar so for all pages that should not show up in the menu bar you can
add the <code>ShowInNavBar: false</code> entry in the page front matter like so:</p>
<pre><code>Title: My page that shouldn't show up in the NavBar
ShowInNavBar: false
---
# Content
</code></pre>
<p>Once that was done I created <a href="https://wyam.io/recipes/blog/themes">overrides</a> for</p>
<ul>
<li>The page and post footers by creating the <code>_Footer.cshml</code> and <code>_PostFooter.cshtml</code> files. The page
footer was straight forward but the post footer required some additional work to get the links
to the previous and next post to function correctly. Fortunately <a href="https://daveaglick.com/">Dave Glick</a>
was very helpful on the <a href="https://gitter.im/Wyamio/Wyam">gitter</a> page for Wyam and pointed out
that there are collections that you can iterate over to find out what the previous and
next posts are.</li>
</ul>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/d2825f2c5d67ab30d15ce179ced4b30f.js"></script>
<ul>
<li>The sidebar which contains my little &lsquo;about me&rsquo; blurp.</li>
<li>The navbar which by default orders pages alphabetically and does not contain a link to the home page.
In my Docpad blog both those things are not true, so I did a bit of Razor coding and generated the
navbar items myself</li>
</ul>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/7645c478ae08c94d3716ca8e8ad41c4c.js"></script>
<p>These changes got most of the pages looking pretty close to what they should be, but yet not quite
the same as it was.</p>
<h3>Tweaking</h3>
<p>If you don't have an existing layout for your blog or you don't mind changing the layout then
after the previous steps you should have a very nice looking blog that works just fine. However it
turns out I'm stuborn and specific in the way I want things to look. In this case I wanted my blog
to not look any different than the existing one does, at least for the time being. So that meant
I had to do a fair amount of tweaking.</p>
<p>The first major tweak was to get the sidebar looking like it should. This turned out to be a little
harder than I expected because it required overriding the <code>_Layout.cshtml</code> page. While this is a
bigger step than the other overrides it also meant I was able to make the pages look exactly like
I wanted and I was able to re-use my CSS files.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/5e3520e0f150176f529b1972fc2042a7.js"></script>
<p>One of the more tricky parts was to generate a list of the last 10 posts. Originally I was using
the list of posts, however because this is the layout page that is used for all pages it might
well be that some pages are generated before the full post list is available (say hello to the
<a href="/tags">tags</a> pages). Once again Dave Glick came through and pointed me to the <a href="https://wyam.io/recipes/blog/pipelines">RawPosts</a>
collection which is generated right at the beginning of the cycle.</p>
<p>Once the issues with the sidebar were resolved the next step was to show the last five blog posts
on the home page. By default Wyam will place excepts on the home page with a link to the actual post
in the post title. However what I wanted was the full post, excluding the comment section. Once again
the <code>RawPosts</code> collection came to the rescue which allowed me to iterate over the last five posts
and get their pre-rendered content.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/d0d83eb2c636a5d3b63b5bf0cce6029c.js"></script>
<p>Some additional hacking also allowed me to reuse the <code>_PostHeader.cshtml</code> file for both the posts
on the home page, for which the title links to the actual post page, and for the post page in which
the title is just a header.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pvandervelde/465c0a2399f135a25e656b0d15c1866a.js"></script>
<p>With these changes the blog looks (almost) exactly like it used to look except that it is now
being generated by <a href="https://wyam.io">Wyam</a>. All in all I have to say I'm pretty happy with the result
and with how easy it was to move from Docpad to Wyam. And as a bonus I understand much more of
how Wyam works and how my own blog is generated.</p>
